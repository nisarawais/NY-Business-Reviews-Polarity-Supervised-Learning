Give them a call. Greg Sr. is a plethora of information and knowledge. All but one time they‚Äôve had the part/parts that I needed in-stock in there warehouse. The one and only time they didn‚Äôt they had the part within a weeks time. Customer service is out standing. I am a return customer and will continue to do future business. And I would like to thank Greg Sr. for making those tough projects easier. Support your local business.	null	null	0x89d36ce30f435a0b:0x653dafeefe71be49	1

They have the nicest people and you will not be let down if you go here!! I ended up getting the Iced green tea matcha latte! It was so good and refreshing! You guys made my day.

1.0943496860703449e+20	Tony Pinto	1384783434547	5	I came by yesterday to pick up some pizza on the way home and the food was amazing.  Best crust around - easily.  I ordered a calzone, one chocolate slice (amazing), two cheese slices and a potato slice (all for my wife and me and lunch for her next day).  Everything was perfect.  The guy behind the counter seemed nice (I think he may have been the owner) and price-wise may have been a bit pricey, but then again, the pizza really is that much better and then again, pizza prices around the city are about the same.  I'll definitely go back.	null	null	0x89c258ffaeaba947:0x8355860772a595a9	1

But when I went they had no regular pizza just random other slices (which were later burnt and didn't taste good) .

She has thorough knowledge of home construction and the local market. When we viewed an apartment Cristina would give comments on the quality of construction, finish, appliances, etc. She also led me through multiple rounds of negotiation to get to a price i was comfortable with. In the end I found the place that was perfect for me.	null	null	0x89c259ac39e91d7b:0x639357d22ed06a46	1

They will let you taste, and there is a good variety of flavors.   The owner was very friendly, and shared our craving for Malaga flavor (rum/raisin).   Apparently it doesn't sell that well, but if it is as good as the flavors we tasted, try it.	null	null	0x89c259939c21b365:0x8fdf81cd33119058	1

I sit down, specifically ask if the barber who took me could do a flat top (not to mention they have a specific listing for a flat top on their price list--it's $3 more than the standard $10 haircut). Well, to make a long story short, I could have gotten a better haircut at the local butcher shop. My only consolation is that hair grows.

There was a lot that we didn't know given that this is the first home that we'd purchased. Jeff was always there with the answers when we needed them. Jeff was super helpful throughout the home search, the inspection, the final walkthrough, and the closing meeting. Michelle was great at helping us through the bidding process.

All you need to do is google the name Mike at Tribeca Gym then read all the negative reviews before agreeing to join. I joined Tribeca on 4/29 and was charged $53 bucks.  ($3 prorated for April and $50 for May).  On May 5th, I was charged an additional $50 for May. I spoke with Lauren and informed her I was charged twice for May.  She said oh, if you decide to leave the gym that will be your last payment. Well two weeks later I decided to leave Tribeca Gym and join NYSC.   On June 1, I was charged an additional $50 bucks.  I emailed Mike the owner and informed him I was charged twice in May so I should not have to pay for June.  I even emailed him my bank statement and he had the nerve to tell me it was shell gas station that charged me twice. I mean come on really, like I don‚Äôt know how to read my bank statement. After going back and forth I told him to keep the $50 however I plan on making a complaint with the BBB.  My advice is to stay clear away from this gym.  Do your research about Mike and join a real gym like NYSC.  THANK GOODNESS I cancelled my membership.  His customer service skills SUCK!!!!!	null	"""{'time': 1516802285294, 'text': """"Hi India!

Brenda Kent worked a huge miracle when she fixed the most horrific damage and awful color another salon did to my hair. She worked her magic mixing and fixing. I cried everyday till she saved my hair and my spirits.

1.0481480069363316e+20	Shady Assassa	1546133232182	1	I'm not sure how this place is around. They recently bought out continued care and it has been a huge step down in all respects. Supply order came incorrect and after 7-8 days, whereas continued care would always fullfil orders correctly and within 1-2 days max. In addition, getting a hold of someone on the phone is like winning the lotto. Today alone I wasted my poor cell phone's battery cells to deal with 60 minute hold times, followed by a hang up, then a 90 minute hold time, followed but me giving up. I'm going to research my options for finding a different supplier.	null	null	0x89c28179a7691c81:0x9273c741111f591d	0

1.1291468629398041e+20	Michael Stewart	1573926719917	1	125 Street /Park Ave is the Metro -North's Harlem line stop. It's the corridor  to the NYC subway system which is a block's walk to the east . Unlike the mid-town Grand Central it's not a physical structure, it's mainly a transit hub. Like any hub in NYC its a magnet for homelessness and hustlers and panhandlers. In addition their is a lot of Opioid treatment centers nearby so be on point always. Like in the movies the police are never around until after something happens.  As the area becomes gentrified hopefully things will get better.	null	null	0x89c2f60badb925a9:0xc1306521b63d1a7	0

He didn't try to run me ragged and keep me long hours to generate a nice bill. He was just direct and he spoke in a way that I didn't have no questions.

This is one of the few Stewarts that looks unique like a 2 story lake house or something but the store is the first floor only. Normally the staff at all Stewarts is fantastic, but not the best compared the other locations. A few times now when we asked for them to make us a breakfast sandwich (when they didn‚Äôt have them in the warmer) we got the eye roll and the huffing. Strange as normally these are made without issue and the signs always say ask us if you need something made.	null	null	0x89de5f9627d4e973:0x5b0cbc68d57ffefb	0

1.1104469102905062e+20	Mary Jane	1500482145126	1	This place is a complete DUMP. Teresa is a rude bit*h with a constant nasty attitude. I overheard her tell an employee whos hand was bleeding to scoop ice cream and to wear a glove. Thats absolutely disgusting. Meanwhile she was sitting around doing nothing. And their hot food is always expired but they will sell it anyways! Not to mention I noticed an entire rack of crackers that has been expired for months! Why are these rude miserable employees being paid if they can't even clean the place?? All these people care about is their comissions check. I overhead teresa giving a new employee a hard time about putting ONE extra tomato on a sandwich but she waited until after they completed the sandwich before she even said anything.... really? And then my husband and I were getting coffee and we noticed teresa sitting there giving us the dirtiest looks and then looking at another employee next to us and then back at us. I so badly wanted to ask her what her problem was and to fix her disgusting face but instead, we left my coffee on the counter and proceeded to leave the store completey. I don't know what the other employee was saying nor do i care. These people dont know me and dont need to be making their customers feel that uncomfortable like that. I understand nobody likes their job but this woman looks like shes been on her period her entire life. Ive never seen a stewarts employee so miserable and rude anywhere in new york state. And she is usually sitting in the back doing nothing, i dont understand what she's getting paid for exactly when the most effort put into anything is her being nasty towards her co workers and rude to paying customers. Management here is a joke. This place is FILTHY and disgusting! These people don't even have the decency to wipe the tables down for customers to sit at. And the entire inside of the store is just covered in dust and dirt.	null	null	0x89de5f9627d4e973:0x5b0cbc68d57ffefb	0

Maybe the owner is nicest. .but everyone else makes it very VERY obvious they will fill orders of friends that come  in and skip over me . This had happened 2 times ..   a couple months ago when they first opened I went and I had a terrible experience didn't go back for a month then I went back and had a better experience I live 3 doors away so it's very convenient and I enjoy smoothies . Depending on who's working you can stand there from anywhere from 10 to 25 minutes ordering one item sometimes. I understand there are online orders and GrubHub but I've been a manager, food server, shift supervisor, dishwasher, I've done it all in restaurants and whenever there is a customer that walks , you never let them stand there and wait for one item ! when you're standing there doing delivery items, noway. you quickly do the item for the customer that's present in the restaurant get them finished paid and out the door then continue your out going orders. And I feel as though every time I come here the opposite happens I walk in order one item and wait 20 minutes.. quality of the smoothies is five stars. The service needs to get a little better, there's also been a few miscommunications with orders when they're very simple.	null	null	0x89c25be3a039c8a1:0x4d6e40977ecbd2d	0

Being the first time I was there I chatted a lot. At the end a little Reiki quieted me both my mouth and mind, brought me back to center. Great way to finish up a massage. The location is a tad wonky, Synergy building behind True Value, building 8/9, you walk into a doctor's office waiting room, go bro your right down two short flights of stairs, down a hall to a small waiting room with doors to other rooms, fill out the form on the clipboard.

Even after telling multiple times the manager or worker or owner there over a period of weeks that the organic milk was expired, they left it on the shelves. To the cost of not losing money on that carton of milk where someone could get really sick out of it, not mentioning if your children drank it, they just wouldn't get rid of it. They were hoping someone would buy it not realizing it was expired and by WEEKS, NOT DAYS! And last time I went, I grabbed a few paper coffee cups which I needed for the water I was buying, and they wanted to charge me $1 and spare change for these. Insane!!! I shouldn't have come back, I am clearly an idiot. This is not business and it is ran by cheap, greedy people that don't give a damn about you.

They wanted a review and I gave them a piece of my mind and now I'm waiting in this dentist office with my dad who is having work done  for the past 4 years. He came here for implants and they are giving him a  hard time. Doctor Santos who is working on my dad threatened she was going to put my dad in the hospital and give him intravenous because he's NOT eating. He's unable to eat with the false teeth they gave him as temporary teeth. So it's her doctor Santos FAULT why my dad is loosing weight and not eating. I had it with this dentist. Today is Friday May 18, 2018 and my dad had a 10am appointment. They usually call my dad in early,but not today.It's now 10: 21am and still waiting. Four people came in after we did and they took those people in before my dad who had an appointment first. I guess they give everyone the same time appointment as my dad. So you decide these people are no good and would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS DENTIST TO ANYONE. Wow it's 10:26am and finally we're in the office.	null	null	0x89c2638f5626d3fd:0xf70c80089b60bf2a	0

I give this place five stars and if I could give it 10 I would give it 10! Everyone from Patricia at the front desk to Dr Berger who explained everything to me to the staff of dentist that worked with me so far and the technicians... Every single person was like an angel! I had to get two teeth extracted yesterday. I had an abscess in my jaw and I looked like I had a golf ball in my face! I went there crying! They took me immediately no waiting. In fact I have to make sure I get there a little early from now on because every time I've been there and it's been about 4 times now, I've been about 3 4 minutes late and they have taken me immediately. In my experience, doctors have no respect for your time well these people do. I have to rethink that and have respect for their time. I woke up today and I am in virtually no pain. I know it sounds like BS but my gums are almost closed and I am absolutely amazed at the professionalism and the skill of These Fine people! I am looking forward to finishing my course of treatment there and being able to post a big smiling picture of myself!

1.0332905760672052e+20	Evan Y	1548996908874	1	Second that other 1 star review. Got my phone here and the guy made me sign the paperwork twice because the first time ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt go through‚Äù. Turns out they were 2 different documents. One for my phone and another for a hotspot device/service. He said it comes included in the plan and if I remove it, it won‚Äôt make a difference to my monthly. I called Verizon and they said ‚Äúno, he‚Äôs lying to you. If you remove it, you will save $30 each month‚Äù. SO, I went back, returned it and asked him to remove the service. He said, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing to remove because it doesn‚Äôt make a difference‚Äù. I left, called Verizon again and they helped remove the service and I was able to pay far less per month no thanks to the store. These guys are SCAMMERS and the other reviews are FAKE.	null	null	0x89c2599a13e76d97:0xfaec9117a7e0a5db	0

They treat you with much respect and recognize you by name every time you come into the office. Dr. Fuggetta is the kindest, most down-to-Earth person you could meet. Dr. Fuggetta has helped me relief pain from my neck and lower back. I am currently in a monthly program that will help me completely remove my lower back pain. I highly recommend Rockwood Park Chiropractic.	null	null	0x89c25d876270bb05:0x44d1756992ac1331	1

Some of the bartenders don't know how to mix drinks.  I asked for a certain tequila on the rocks, they were very stingy with the tequila and then charged me $11, mind you this bottle costs less than $25 in the liquor store.

I was recommended to Parkchester Physical therapy for a workers comp related case and my therapist is exceptional. Chirag takes the time to explain the injury, the process, the methods and has worked with all the components of my knee injury. He doesn't pamper me because I'm here to recover, but it's personable, is diligent in my treatments and encourages continued work on my part outside of this location (at home). I am seeing and feeling the results of his attention to detail and appreciate all of his hard work. 5 stars for his work,  4 stars because it takes a while for the paperwork to be processed by whomever handles their workers comp cases.	null	null	0x89c2f4c3cef8b535:0x712bc5e11f215f10	1

I have finally found a place I can favorite and definitely come back. This place is so clean and they are so professional. They took care of my nails, soaking them and then carefully using a nail file not a electric one to remove the gel on my toes and powder gel from my nails. Jessica is amazing, she took her time and made sure she got the colour all the way to the cuticle as well as filing the side of my nails to make sure everything was smooth. I have to say this because a lot of other places leave a big space between the cuticle and the colour. I will definitely be coming back to this place on the regular. I left this place making sure I can book an appt within a month with Jessica again.

We found him abandoned in an industrial park. After a quick vet visit he stayed with us overnight, we were up every 2 hours to bottle feed him. For two months, Kitten Angels fostered him, they bottle fed him and kept him safe until he was ready to come home to us. Without Kitten Angels, we wouldn't have been able to keep our little Gizmo. He's now 3 years old, and he's wild, spunky, snuggly and oh so loving. Thank you Kitten Angels for all you do!

I contacted them on Facebook after seeing the cat I wanted in pet supplies plus, and within a few hours I was set up to meet with the foster the next day. At the time my cat only had one of the 3 distemper shots. I paid the $100 adoption fee and I was then able to contact kitten angels and get the last two distemper shots at their pet store clinics for no additional charge. So from my experience I would recommend them.	null	null	0x89de565c710467c3:0x31661e064d0c3346	1

They told me to come to the clinic so they can fit me for a diaphragm. I called to make an appointment for the Caya diaphragm. At the clinic,  I was asked a ton of personal questions and had to pee in a cup and wait for the practitioner.  She came into the room with the old fashioned diaphrams.  I assumed they knew it was for Caya since I said this over the phone. Turns out, the new Caya diaphragm was not known to this clinic.  So basically I wasted my time.

They were booked up for almost 2 months. The employee at Henrietta told me the Greece location would be able to assist with the installation. An appointment was made and I was email with the invoice. I arrived early at the Greece location only to be told they do not have installers on Sundays. The employee, Riley was able to schedule me for the following Thursday. I do appreciate his efforts, but the blame here lies with the Manager as he should have contacted me directly as to the issue. All this is time sensitive and while the reschedule will work out, the inconvenience of taking time off work and driving the that location twice is not good business!

The man who came to get her was very nice and understanding. All the employees were very nice. We had some confusion orginally, but Pete Rose helped us get everything sorted out. The funeral itself was very nice and they let us even have dolphin pictures play on the projector. My sister in law liked dolphins. We were able to pick songs that she liked to play and everyone was very professional. Sidney was one of the people who helped us and she could tell that my mother in law was having a hard time with the holidays coming (Christmas and Thanksgiving). At the end of the funeral Sidney read a beautiful poem that was very touching.  The funeral home worked hard to help us with all our concerns and even when we didnt understand, they made the effort to reach out to make sure things were satisfactory.	null	{'time': 1583769972708, 'text': 'Amanda, losing a loved one is a very difficult thing.

1.0965662686847784e+20	Lee Yong June	1543792065616	5	I was looking for a place to eat some oyster and someone recommended me this place. With all the high expectation and excitement, I walked into to this place. First thing I noticed was the clean and cozy vibe of the place. The next was the professionalism of the staffs. I was well greeted with a warm welcome. Next was the food. The quality of the food was just great. Since I did come for the oyster, I will start with the oyster. The quality of the oyster was very fresh. Next will be the rolls that I ate. The rolls were well made with good quality fish and the rice was just right. I also ate some uni pasta, and it wasn't something I never had before, but for sure I will eat it again. And lastly, the octopus legs, very tangy, chewy, well cooked and the taste went so well with the mushrooms. I will definitely come back again.

It is a very inconvenient bank, I live out towards waverly and there is only a handful of these little banks in broome county‚Ä¶ when I used the drive thru a clerk did not return my ID to me. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it.. long story short, four months go by and I went inside to deposit money for the loan I had, one of the women handed me my license back. You couldn‚Äôt have called me or looked my flipping information that you didn‚Äôt return my Identification card with.	null	null	0x89daeea10187ed01:0x621a023510144110	0

Not with Tops, you can first see what you are buying, (actual size) width, depth, etc.  With Tops you can buy 1 of whatever you're looking for and try it out before making a huge purchase.  They have a really cool, less comercial store next door for whatever gadget you might need for the house also.

They have Wines that are local but from around the world as well. The wine selection is great but my favorite drinks are the fresh Mojitos. They grow the mint on site so it is superb. They have couches to lounge on and games to play if your in the mood. Its a little off the beaten path but well worth the trip.	null	null	0x89d08170595ae59f:0x4eec7e5f92f10df8	1
1.0893744862306841e+20	Jim Hilker	1419904102651	4	I've been to Corks & More several times and always find it to be a very laid-back, relaxing, enjoyable place.  They are set up for any season; with the outdoor seating and deck on the waterfront for the summer and early Autumn, and the spacious indoor seating rooms - one with a huge fireplace.  The seating has an abundance of comfortable couches, sofas, love seats with tall tables mixed in here and there.  There is also a wrap-around bar to sit at if you wish.  They have an incredible self-service wine dispensing system that operates on pre-paid swipe cards.  The selection and variety is vast and outstanding.  They also have a great selection of craft beer on tap and if you're into whiskey, well they have a large selection of makes and quality range.  The food is all about small plates.  There is no dinner menu, just an expanded array of appetizers.  They are really good, but seem a little on the high price side in regards to the small portions they deliver.  All in all you won't be disappointed with Corks & More.  Come early and hang out for the live music they have all the time.  This is a very good addition to the Ithaca NY nite-out scene.	null	null	0x89d08170595ae59f:0x4eec7e5f92f10df8	1

1.1215101635638447e+20	keymapper	1546875878234	4	There are some things for which a small boutique operation is favorable over a super-vertically-integrated-mega-over-managed-machine, and pediatrician is one of them. This practice has just one doctor and he's a great doctor. You know you will always get a familiar face who remembers and develops a long term relationship with your child. They do not overbook and I've never had to wait long for an appointment, and even same day appointments have been available whenever I needed one, yet I've never felt rushed during a visit either. I also like that the waiting room is full of toys rather than a blaring tv. The minor drawbacks of this being a small shop are easily tolerable (no they don't have their own app for you to make appointments with, their facilities are a bit no-frills and some of their equipment is not shiny and new).	null	null	0x89c24c311b46e957:0x7ef0c5884950a15	1

I had just moved into this area and didn't know anyone, so I went with the inspector that my real estate agent recommended.  The guy had a very clever name based on a fictional detective.  Too bad he was not as clever!  Lets just say that he missed several major issues with the house.  Major issues that were blatantly evident to the plethora of contractors that had to clean up messes within days of me moving in (to the tune of almost 50k).  Don't take any chances with one of the biggest purchases that you will make in your life!  Learn from my mistake!  Christine is professional and very thorough.

They saved my home from further damage.  They explained the entire process, reassured me, and worked with a difficult insurance company.

The last two times have made me not want to try to order again.  The Wings I ordered a couple weeks ago were inedible.  They were so overcooked that you couldn't bite the meat without fear of breaking a tooth.  It was like they were double deep fried and both times they were deep fried they were left in far to long.  The pizza today, the crust underneath was blackened a bit in places yet doughy when you bit into it as if undercooked.  The sauce was running and they cheese was very heavy which would be okay if the sauce and the crust could handle it, but when you went to pick up a slice it was limp and flopped downward,  it ripped the cheese off and then sprayed you with running sauce.  The salad was delicious however.	null	null	0x89c332992853d48d:0xa6b4ab1dfc04380c	0

So, we just don't order those from them anymore!  Definitely a good place to eat!	null	null	0x89c332992853d48d:0xa6b4ab1dfc04380c	1

Everything is so fresh, unique, and incredibly tasty. The only thing holding me back from going every day is the price. The rolls are around $6 a box and the hot food is around $10 a dish. The salads are small and $9 which is a bit ridiculous, but seriously worth the money, so I get it. Their vegetarian options are stellar. Smoked tofu rolls and multiple different kinds of salads are a huge draw. They have a spicy seaweed salad and a quinoa and onion salad that are both to die for. I wish I could have them every day for lunch! The staff is also incredibly friendly and the environment is incredibly gracious and warm.	null	null	0x89c259a72beb76f1:0x829dd9752e6c045	1

Thank you for a fun day on set.	null	null	0x89c2804f9c14d6eb:0xb2519defbfa497e9	1

Two Historical Markers (landmarked) are across from each other in the graveyard and across the road. Back down towards town just past the Mulford farm is another landmarked marker for the First Town Church. A must stop if you're touring the Windmills of East Hampton, not far away (1500yds as the crow flies) but on private property is the one built into a house (Robert Downey Jr. owns it). The graveyard, village geen and village pond are all NRHP landmarked. Mill is in back of the Payne Home Sweet Home museum at #14 James lane, it is the Pantigo Windmill, in 1917 Gustav Buek purchased and moved it to the backyard of HSH from Pantigo rd & Egypt ln, where it had been for 72 years.

She measures and checks each nail shape and length next to one another and each hand. I get compliments on my nails every day, sometimes multiple times a day. All the techs are super friendly and have a lot of regulars who you can tell all love them.

This office had been highly recommended to me my several people, and I needed a dentist closer to me, so I decided to give them a try. I scheduled my first appointment that seemed pretty standard. I thought it odd they didn't ask about xrays. The day of the first appointment was disastrous. Start to finish I was berated and made to feel like she was rushed. I was 10 minutes late, totally my fault. If the communication had been made that they may not be able to complete this due to the time constraints I would have been a little more tolerant, but no Walked in door and no discussion, just sit down get to work. No discussion on what needed to be done. No plan of action. Just zoom. And Zoom she went. It was awful. No bedside manner. No compassion. Just get done with this and on to next. It was disgusting. I walked out of there not feeling like a cherished patient, but as just another mouth to drill in. I hope people have a better experience then me. This is the reason I NEVER changed dentists to begin with."""	null	{'time': 1522894413446, 'text': 'We take immense pride in creating a great experience for our patients and are truly sorry that your first visit was anything but that.

I bought my car from here a few months ago, and now have had nothing but problems-leaking power steering fluid, the starter went. Not to mention they sold me a car they knew had a non working a/c and never mentioned it, another $300+ fix for a new compressor. I would listen to the bad reviews and save your money to go somewhere else. I only went here because I thought it saved me the trouble of trying to go through the dmv during covid. Beware and have a reliable mechanic check it out first, otherwise avoid this place!	null	null	0x89dd2bd82b72ec5f:0x2505e6f89d137f53	0

I bank at a few banks but could not find anything that was available on a Saturday. I went to the location at the MacArthur airport where another customer told me that the Bay Shore branch had employees working on a Saturday. I arrived, waited on line (moved fast) and explained my situation to a teller. He was not interested in assisting me and was quite short. I did not like his attitude and chose to speak with the representative at the lobby desk. I met with Fanny Mendez and she was outstanding. Fanny was patient, kind, helpful, and her main goal was to offer excellent customer service (unlike the teller that I originally met with.) A company should want people to brag about them and I am comfortable bragging about Fanny. She should train people on how to treat the clients that bank with you. She spent so much time with me and although I could not take care of what I intended to (no fault of hers,) I am glad to have met her and worked with her. I believe in providing both negative and positive reviews and I would have given a """"5"""" but the teller had a poor approach to customer service. Thank you, Fanny.

While it‚Äôs probably true that all of the restaurants at the Jetblue terminal are probably owned and operated by the same food conglomerate, my wife and I were very impressed with both the food as well as the server, Brendon, who was gracious and seemed to take great interest in our happiness with our breakfast.  While this was our first time eating at La Vie, we will definitely return.  It‚Äôs conveniently located next to the Starbucks and often obscured by their long lines.   Initially we were on the Starbucks line but then had time to read La Vie‚Äôs poster board menu and decided( since we noticed an empty table) to opt out of our line and enjoy our granola and berries breakfast. And their coffee was excellent!

The pharmacists listen carefully to assess one's needs, consult with the ordering physician as necessary, educate the patient and the family about medical marijuana, and give hope by providing information about the many options. And the pharmacists and receptionist do all this with obvious compassion. For those in severe pain and for those who love the sufferer, this dispensary is a God-send.	null	null	0x89de097f823408c5:0x58f748430702e89c	1

1.160145368278609e+20	Nicolette Edwards	1588718258304	1	Where do I begin with this place?...sigh..Originally they were located on Springfield Blvd in Cambria Heights NY, they decided to close that store not even giving their customers a week to make arrangements, store employee told me the day before they closed only because I went to the store to pick up a package..I lost a few packages because of this.  Transferred to the store on Sutphin Blvd/ 118 Ave in Jamaica, same thing, they closed as of April 1, same thing, notified on March 31, no time to make preparations for packages and mail that were already in route.  The manager advised I could go directly to USPS in Rochdale Village to pick up my mail/packages, went there and was told by the employees there that they had no knowledge about held mail for the customer's of LJHUB..I had to wait from April 1- April 20 missing important mail and packages..again lost packages because of this place and all they offered was 1 month of free mailbox service.  Totally understand the situation regarding the COVID19 pandemic BUT at the same time the USPS never closed and they are operating in the same capacity as a mail facility.  Today went there to take care of getting documents copied/emailed/faxed and unable to gain entry into the store..all transactions done outside.  This is ridiculous!!! How can business be conducted like this?  I'll be cancelling all services with them in the near future.	null	null	0x89c266d773121cb1:0xe4d90bbd6d9ebb79	0

Darren was glad to explain to me step by step of what to expect in the inspection over the phone. He was able to accommodate to the time and date I needed and was punctual. The inspection took about 2 ¬Ω hrs. Darren did a thorough job. The house was fairly crowded so he inspected each floor on his own then did a walk through with me and explained all things he checked, pointed out what needed to be fixed and answered any questions I had. He takes plenty of pictures, writes down the report as he goes and gives you a paper copy at the end. What I liked most about Darren was his patience. As a first time homebuyer I needed lot of explaining (I don‚Äôt know much about houses) but not once he showed frustration which I really appreciate.

1.0842929472200253e+20	Umar Minhas	1509859158190	5	John is the man!  He not only took care of our 2017 Nissan Pathfinder which was involved in a MVA, but he also installed our running boards which we had sitting around just because our last installer didn't work out (John did it at no cost).  John had me wait a few hours for the running board installation but then got me some snacks while I waited!  It's not every day you have that kind of a personable experience at an Auto Body Shop.  John was also very considerate to my wife and kids the day of our accident by facilitating our rental car by the time we arrived at his shop.  All in all, this place is highly recommended.	null	null	0x89c28597382ab4bb:0xe1316e9961b3ac0b	1

They told me the job would be completed in no more than 2 weeks yet the job was completed doubled the amount of time quoted. They charged my insurance company ($7000+) way more than any other body shop quoted. Save your self from the stress and stay away from this shop!!	null	null	0x89c28597382ab4bb:0xe1316e9961b3ac0b	0

The 5 star reviews come across as bought and paid for. INSINCERE! And the 1 star reviews come across as real horrible experiences that people have had and are desperately trying to help others avoid! I will take their advice! I'm writing this to show you the simple fact that reviews have an impact. I would never even call a doctors office with reviews like this.	null	null	0x89dd3dd5789c185f:0xfdbbf67eed4a6f79	0

I was able to pick what color I wanted, and I spoke to the nail tech about what polish would look good on me. She was very kind and very professional. The salon was very clean, and the nail tech kept her work station very clean as well. She wore gloves and had a face mask on, so I was not concerned with hygiene.  Her tools were cleaned before she worked on my nails, and she was quick and efficient. A gel manicure cost me $25,(which I think is very reasonable). I will definitely revisit this salon for my nail needs. :)	null	null	0x89dd3e43a0065e15:0xad8020a307bbcda4	1

The folks that coordinate the food pantry are very nice and helpful and don't seem to look down on those in need of some help. They provide mostly canned or jarred goods, some paper products and bakery items (breads and goodies) stores can not sell due to their """"sell by"""" date (perfectly fine bakery items) a little treat is nice too.

An upstairs they have community service offices which can actually help you get health insurance, finish schooling (GED) and certain days of the week they have AA & NA meetings where anyone can feel free to join if there looking for discreet kind help. Even if your not religious the coordinator is very careful not to affend anyone whether your atheist, Christian, etc. Which I thought was very commendable for being held in the basement of a church. Pretty safe spot too for parking even tho surroundeding area has had bad issues in the past. I've yet to actually see one  :-)	null	null	0x89dd3e12d2e669d3:0xf0923cab7495fbd3	1

The administration has assigned me to a room with a torn wall and a discoloured tub, where a previous tenant might have been trying to pay bribes. The forced roommates assignments resulted in persistent dramatic conflicts. For which, I had to request to relocate and find out that the property could and would require student to relocate for a higher charge based on loopholes in the contract agreement. Fire alarms in unoccupied bedrooms breakdown like censorship, and the maintenance personnel had been very rogue and insensible in their visits. The process of mail pick up is full of hassles, that one could never expect to receive anything important here. I think some selected tenants might have experienced harassment likewise. After some comparison on market rates, I believe the property has undercharged by half of its fair price and has not been living up to its investment in servitude at all.	null	{'time': 1613771038583, 'text': 'Hi Yingran, we are sorry that you feel we have not lived up to expectations.

The tactical knowledge taught at MFC has improved my understanding of self and enhanced my decision making skills. Taking lessons with Sergey my love for the sport has deepened thanks to his passion and attentiveness. He takes his job very seriously and his commitment and energy is inspiring. No matter your level or age, if you are willing to learn there is a plethora of knowledge and experience among the coaches and students at MFC. Today I view fencing as not just a sport, but as a reflection of life and a great teacher of discipline and personal confidence.	null	null	0x89c259aca1fd0879:0x610253e59b4b22d6	1

The staff is very rude and treat you, the customer, with disdain, as if they're doing you a favor. The manager of this branch is very rude and lazy. She speaks to you in a disrespectful, ironic manner as if you are her acquaintance.. Overall, the way she and her staff conduct themselves is unacceptable for a brand-name bank. She also talks about you with her co-workers in another language (Russian I think) right in front of you, which is super-disrespectful. Customer service is slow and inexperienced, even though they're all deep in their 40/50s.. Because of this, I will probably never do business with Santander again.

The problem is when you want open a brokerage account for investing.  Do not expect to be able to have a self managed brokerage account.  It seems nearly impossible to be able to do.  You can only setup an investment account which needs to be done with a traveling investment adviser.  You can not set one up on the phone or with someone that is always at the bank.  You will need to listen to the advisers whole story and he will try discourage you from doing your own investing.  I agree that this might be good for those that don't know much about investing, but for those that do know what they want to invest in already, it is a torturous feat to have to go through.  By the way, their minimum investment deposit is $25,000.00 for those that don't have that kind of money to invest yet.  Other banks have no minimum and do not make you go through so much trouble."""	null	null	0x89c244ef600a0801:0x9868ee32009d72ef	0

I went to Jackson Tailors after the tailor that was supposed to do my alterations did not finish them. I had a shalwar top that needed the sleeves shorter, an anarkali that needed the waist adjusted and sleeves added, a sari top that needed to be adjusted and a sari that needed pleating. There were 2 gentlemen there that helped me. One did the sari and the other did the other 3 items. They took my measurements on a Sunday afternoon and They were ready for pick up the following Sunday. The work they did was absolutely amazing and professional! It was clear from their demeanor that they knew what they were doing and there was a high level of skill. It is true that they‚Äôre not oozing sunshine, but I didn‚Äôt really mind as I was desperate. I just needed their services asap and they were available. The sari pleating was $45 and the other items cost $110. I‚Äôm not sure how steep that price is because I‚Äôve never had to have Indian wear adjusted, but I would say for the quality of work they produced, it was well worth the money!

I am a dependent foreign National here, so keybank has slightly different policies with respect to security purposes, which I highly respect. But the did not receive right response from another branch of keybank so I finally gave this branch a last shot. And to my surprise the branch Manager was a sweetheart!! He figured out what the issue was and resolved it and made sure I had both my cards working before I left from the office!! I would definitely visit this branch in future as the professionals working here are the best at what they do and also very customer friendly!!	null	{'time': 1565014741030, 'text': 'Hello Chaitra: Thank you so much for taking the time to provide your feedback and great rating, we really appreciate it.

1.0372597766401575e+20	JiHwan Choi	1567900339550	1	I reserved the dessert bar 2 weeks ahead for a special occasion. It was our anniversary. We were so excited, but when we got there at 6:55pm for our 7pm reservation. The dessert bar door was locked. I never thought that the restaurant was closed because we got a confirmation message 30 minutes before the reservation. We waited in front of the door for 30 minute, constantly calling their number, which they didn‚Äôt respond. There should be at least a sign that the bar is closed, and they should have contacted to the people who made a reservation. We ruined the day that supposed to be wonderful. Thanks a lot. Hope u don‚Äôt charge us $50 for ‚Äòcancelling‚Äô our reservation that we couldn‚Äôt even enter. I can‚Äôt believe such customer service can exist.	null	null	0x89c259ce9edf3dd9:0x440ce0eef75fd84	0

It is quite impressive in this day and age to see such dedication and professionalism. I highly recommend them for all related needs.	null	null	0x89c2b10986f40415:0xf35e028c75a9be6b	1

A customer should be shown what space what they will be renting and if it's big enough or small enough or even wide enough for their use. I am not pleased with this facility at all.

Unfortunately I have been experiencing very frizzy and dry hair. I have been back now twice and they are very helpful and accommodating with giving me product to help and styling techniques as well. I'm still unsure if this result was just due to the extremely humid weather we've been experiencing or the chemicals were just to harsh on my hair.

I was a costumer for years and if you don't get a fixed rate or you're paying attention to the current price of oil you will get hosed.  If your contract ends and you don't like the price you will get hosed.  Completely disappointed with myself for stay with them so long.  Learn from my mistake and don't stay with this company.

I am sorry that I did. I can say that the techs are really great and friendly but the customer service is abysmal.  They do not care at all about their customers.  We have a compressor that is only 3 years old (we just moved in to our house last September).  The system has not been working as it should and you would think Burke would be able to figure it out but all they do is continue to charge me money without any fix at all.  I was first told I needed a new return for upstairs.  Well $1200 later it still is hot.  Then somehow our 3 year oid motor died so now Burke is charging me $600 for new one and after their own tech said that it was probably caused by all the turning on and off at THEIR suggestion.  The latest problem is that the system keeps tripping and the Manager Tom and his tech were supposed to be at our house first thing this morning and so my poor wife waited all morning only to be told that they will be coming at 2 now.  Are they serious???? No care at all for her time.  I am disgusted with this company.  i am ready to cancel and convince my parents to do the same.	null	{'time': 1535040838035, 'text': 'Robert- We thank you for taking the time to speak with our Customer Service Manager.

Jenn checked us in and was excellent in letting us get our way, moving us to our desired site, and coming to check on us. I ran into a guy name Dave, who was cleaning bathrooms, and I started asking him about the campgrounds. Who would guess the owner was cleaning the bathrooms. But if you saw the bathrooms you would understand his attention to perfection and his amazing creativity. He invited us for coffee and we got a personal tour. Their plans for this campground and conference center are extraordinary and very exciting. I think it's going to have a huge draw, and so beautiful. You can see Toronto in the distance, across Lake Ontario. Enjoy the photos. I intend to post a video soon.

Weekend getaway ‚úì Family reunion ‚úì Family camping trip ‚úì Team building conference ‚úì Youth Retreat ‚úì Wedding ‚úì Bachlorette or Stag Getaway ‚úì Fishing Trip ‚úì Wine Trail Excursion ‚úì. You name it they can help your accommodation needs.  At the temple of this reviews they are still renovating for opening in the spring but we stayed in the Bed and Breakfast and got to discuss the future plans with the owners and we became very excited about booking further vacations with them because they have big plans for the former youth retreat / conference center.  It is great to get away and unwind from the daily stress.  I am sure when this destination is fully open and complete it will be a real jewel for Olcott, NY.  If you are planning for your next big summer getaway - definitely connect with the staff here at Niagara Shores.	null	null	0x89d486fb46b35e0f:0xf89fc350fa1c93f0	1

Apparently there is an interesting function in the Geek Squad customer service system, after somewhere between 55-60 min the system disconnects you. Seriously, someone finally admitted it to me. I have been disconnected 4 times. I can only assume this is a way of wearing you down and not  getting your service plan claims processed. The point of this review ? The next time you have a choice between the cell phone company warranty and Geek Squad protection, don't think twice. The insurance through the carriers, all carriers is far superior to the Geek squad protection plans.	null	null	0x89de74cfe12aba11:0xf90ca36bdcd5df13	0

While assembling our new sofa, they noticed a small tear in the leather on the back of one of the arms, in a spot I would have never noticed. They called my attention to it, and then called the owner. She then assured me they would get us a new arm by the end of the week, as soon as they could get one. Cue the next afternoon, barely 18 hours later, and the delivery driver were back at my door with the replacement piece. I love the sofa, but I really love the honesty of the workers, and the integrity of the owners.	null	null	0x89c24518634191a5:0xbfbf0dd1c24e3dab	1

Even when all I provide is a description of the issue the owner listens and provides great next steps to resolve the problem. I recently stopped in for new knobs for my range. I only took one with me but the owner asked the right questions and sent me home with 2 options to try. I will definitely shop here for my appliances, when needed.

You dismissed the greeting in silence and proceeded to look around.  After a few minutes of browsing, the same staff member offered assistance again, to only get the second dismissal.  One of our staff doctors came out of the office and you asked the doctor if she could assist.  She kindly responded that she is with a patient at this time and offered the help of one of the staff members.  At that moment, you hastily rushed out of the store.

I get calls letting me know when my prescription is ready, if it needs a refill , or if there is any type of issue with it. Its also really cool that you can see whats ready for pickup online if you have an account. The pharmacists are really nice too. I got a new prescription and received a follow up call a few days after  from one of the pharmacists to make sure everything is okay with the new medication and to ask if i had any questions about it. That was the first pharmacy I've used to have done that, and I think thats really awesome.	null	null	0x89c262afbe30dce7:0x3522bac9d970a2f5	1

1.0477018870130749e+20	Kristen Coakley	1630159522768	5	Wow! What a thrilling experience we had attending a Friday night sky viewing. The organizers were all extremely helpful and  friendly, and the astronomer made understanding the stars, planets and nebulas fun. We were able to see the ring nebula, Saturn and its rings, a view of Jupiter and it's moons, and a binary star system through the telescope. They had the field viewing area outlined with red lights which made the ambience so serene and beautiful while gazing at the stars and constellations. We very much enjoyed some of the Greek mythology that accompanies many constellations that the astronomer outlined for all of us. It was a blast for me as an adult so it must be absolutely magical for kids. If you live in the area or are here on vacation looking for something to top off your day of adventure in the Adirondacks, this is a must go! Thank you again to everyone at the sky center for putting this together!!	null	null	0x4ccb6a8c190838a3:0x28a8c623a6875ad	1

1.0229960003402323e+20	Moni Garr	1563969992931	1	We drove a few hours to attend an advertised event at this location and arrived a few hours early. No one was at the observatory to welcome all the people that were waiting for the event to start. Many cars full of people were waiting in the parking lot and many got mad that no one was at the observatory, their was no message on FB event page to show if event had been cancelled...about 5 car loads waited for over an hour... Ileft review of our disappointment on their fb event page and people that work at the observatory blamed me, blamed all the disappointed visitors with strange accusations and statements that they don't get paid to show up for public advertised events nor to provide public access to the observatory anyway. Very disappointing experience in so many ways.	null	null	0x4ccb6a8c190838a3:0x28a8c623a6875ad	0

I was apprehensive and not really sure of whether I wanted interlocks, twists, or coil and also size.  Upon calling her for the first time, the told me the price for starter locs and we set a date.  On said date, I met Shelly, she was so nice and reassuring. I expressed my concerns to her, (I have thin hair) she explained what and why the size we choose would be better suited for my hair. Needless to say I got my locs done that day and I must say everyone loved my hair. By the glow I had on my face when I left the shop you would not have know how scared I was to begin with.  Every time I go to the shop it‚Äôs always clean, everyone is always friendly, and I don‚Äôt have to wait for hours.  Shelly is always understanding and professional and her work is beyond amazing.

I love coming here for the relaxing atmosphere & thorough services I always receive. Fanta is AMAZING & was wonderful. We had fun conversations & she answered any questions I had about my skin/services. I‚Äôve also gotten a massage from Sandy and she does an incredible job. Joire‚Äôs Spa also has their own line of skincare products & she used some of them during my facial so I could see how they felt on my skin, which I really loved. I ended up purchasing the Lemongrass toner & am excited to try that. BOOK TODAY!!! You won‚Äôt regret it.

Their attention to detail is amazing. Even the door knobs are fly! My facial was with Vanessa; who was very knowledgeable. Vanessa and I reviewed my current skin care regimen, decided on the type of services I would receive and I felt very relaxed and pampered. I will definitely go back and have already booked my follow up appointment. This is also a BLACK OWNED BUSINESS!

The customer service is great!! Lovely ladies. I went in for a wax service with Vanessa who‚Äôs such a beautiful spirit she tried her best to ease the pain but the Brazilian wax its self was painful! (For me).  I‚Äôm pregnant an due any day she took her time and explained everything as she went along, the only reason i didnt give 5 stars was because during my session another worker came in while i was exposed and it made me feel very uncomfortable . Her response was ‚Äúgirl I‚Äôve seen it all lay back down‚Äù i refused until she left the room just me personally this was my first time here And i just wanted to deal with one person no interruptions. But the worker did need supplies so ... whatever, just think they should have strict rules on entering when session is in progress. Not everyone will be comfortable. Besides that the service was great. Not sure if I‚Äôll go for a Brazilian again (ouch) .. but I‚Äôll definitely will be back to try a facial or something.	null	{'time': 1606676340915, 'text': 'Hi Denise,\nThank you for your kind and honest review.

1.0894448045698558e+20	Candice Ifill	1567626710433	3	I went there several weeks ago as I had a wedding and as I am no longer perming my hair I wanted a silk press. A silk press is very pricey so I assume it is being done by someone that specializes in natural hair. Long story short the silk press looked horrible as I have had and seen silk presses before and it looked like if you had a wash and blow out by the Dominican hair salon, mine looked the total opposite of that. However, the stylist did wash my hair really good, and gave me one of the best trims I ever had. She did a phenomenal job on my hair care and trimming, but the silk press was a no go. The staff was very friendly and professional, even though I was not happy, they treated me very well and I appreciate that as customer service means everything. I will be going back for another trim God willing when the time comes :)	null	null	0x89c24358271e0af1:0x64d127e02176eb09	0

The level of Professionalism was very low and this is just my experience through Email, Phone and/or Text. Appt was booked at least a week in advance. I was TEXTED that I needed to send a $75 Payment through PayPal (which i didn't have) to """"hold"""" my appt. So I had to create 1. The text also stated that if I didn't respond within 4 hours & send pymnt, my appt would be cancelled and """"given away"""". 2days before the appt I began receiving reminder notifications that my appt was now over an hour later than I scheduled it to be. I txtd, emailed and called the nxt day after getting no response. Speaking with the assistant back and forth, who was speaking to the hair stylist NIKKI, i was told that my appt waa """"moved down"""" so that i would not be waiting. WHEN was i going to get a formal notification of this from the stylist or assistant?? So now this would make me late for work on the day of my appt. I was goin to try to keep the appt and work somethin out with my job. I hang up then get a txt saying i must cancel 24 hrs in advance for a refund. I lauged with the emojis. Suddenly, the stylist NIKKI is able to talk to ME. I get a call and she starts by saying """"What's funny"""" ? First off SIS, Im not your friend, man or employee. I'm a CUSTOMER. DNT call me with Sass or Ghettoness. ALL of this is happening bc YOU changed my appt time w/o notice. I respond, im laughing nc im gettng a txt now AFTER your assistant just told me whatever you told her. What sense does it make to txt NOW?? Nobody txtd when it mattered.

The lady who helped me was kind, courteous and very helpful. She was also direct and honest. She told me you will pay about $3 less if you use the Post Office than if you use us - we are a private business. But who wants to wait on line at the post office. Here it was quick and easy. I decided the extra $3 was definitely worth it. So I used them to mail my package. And she walked me through and helped me with the whole process. They had everything I needed. I was able to buy a mailing envelope there. And in the end, it really wasn't that expensive to mail what I needed to mail. So I was really happy. I would definitely return if I needed to send something again.	null	{'time': 1581084038358, 'text': 'Your feedback is of utmost importance to us! Thank you so much.

I test drove a vehicle thinking it was perfect. The dealer was to far from my personal mechanic, and getting it checked out by a 3rd party before buying was something i really wanted to have done. However I didn't know what to do. Then I found Lemon Protector online. He made me aware of issues that I wasn't aware of. I feel better having a pro look at it. It helped neutralize my impulse/excitement buying instincts(which is hard when buying cars). Also the service was fast. I emailed Lemon protectors the night before. The next mourning i received a call confirming the address and billing info. That afternoon I recieved the call with the info on the car.	null	null	0x89e82a74b397f773:0xda50f8cb82ac92c4	1

They charge 250$ a month for your kid to go a half day, (thats roughly 83$ an hour im paying for my son to go to pre k) which isnt really a half day, its 3 measly hours long and if school is closed for the day for """"regions"""" or anything, you are still charged full price. Basically paying for days your kids not even there. Makes no sense. Today will be my kids last day here, i pay too much money to be treated rudely by their staff, especially ones that are with the kids all day. My son was treated poorly because i was a half an hour late picking him up. I got into a minor car accident on the way to get him but when i got there and apologized for being late, before i even had a chance to explain myself the rude woman with glasses interrupts me to say """"hes not to be here before 9 or after 12"""" and literally repeated it about 5 times before my husband had to tell her we got it the 1st 3 times she told us. So under circumstances like that, getting into a car crash, nobody is understanding at all. This place disgusts me after today, if they really had such a problem with me being a little late I dont understand why they wouldn't just call. But like I said, clearly nobody cares what the reason behind it is, they just wanted to be rude and nasty to my husband and I as soon as we walked through the door. Sadly for my son he will be missing out on his friends at school but i know some of their parents and will be telling them all about this incident and how they treated me, someone who PAYS for my kid to go there, after i was in a car accident. Thank God I didn't die because clearly that would have been a huge problem with them because i didnt make it there on time. Oh and had to be rude about me dropping him off 5 minutes before 9... like really. All the money im being charged and they want to be that petty. Save your money for a more respectable, higher class pre k. I honestly shouldn't have expected anything more out of a place in johnstown...."""	null	null	0x89def32e10c3e2b7:0x5a1cc7f0c2250e99	0

I'm retired on Medicare in had a prescription for a 30 day supply for my insulin and they wanted to give me and charge me for a 35 day supply because there was a little extra insulin in the vial instead of just giving it to me without the added copay Walgreens is a rip off when it comes to prescriptions I would advise anybody to go to Sam's Club instead and you do not need to be a member in order to use their Pharmacy.

Twice I've taken my daughters here to be evaluated and twice they did not receive proper care. The first time was Decemeber of 2018. The doctor didnt even examine them because of their symptoms he said they had the flu and prescribed the steroids amongst other medications. I'm a nurse myself and I know what my children were experiencing was not the flu ! The very next morning..less than 12 hours later...I took my daughters to their pediatrician. They were diagnosed with double ear infections...no flu or flulike symptoms. The next incident happened this past Tuesday. I suspected my daughters had thrush in the mouth which is self diagnosable anybody knows thrush when they see it. I take them to this place and I'm told unless they recently took abx they dont have thrush. (Great... but that's not the only cause of thrush. I'm pretty sure babies dont get thrush because of abx specifically. It's also because they put dirty things in their mouths LIKE CHILDREN DO.) He looked in their mouth...seen the white patches. My daughter explained theirs pain when she swallows. I tell them of the foul odor. He took a sample. He sent it to the lab to examined for strep....a bacterial infections...not THRUSH...a fungal infection. I get a phone call """"your daughter is negative for strep. """" well that's great but I never suspected that because she doesnt present with that. We've been waiting two days for a diagnosis and treatment of thrush. The lady on the aftercare line had no explanation for the mistake. This is my last time taking them here.

Called Crunch and they said I cant cancel on phone - so either I visit Mon-Fri in person (when Manager is onsite) or send a certified mail. Latter was not easy for me, so I decided to show up on Friday and the person (Michele Fusca) at gym tells they cant do it because manager is managing his other location. I insisted she should cancel it then, and she said she has no privileges and dont even have an option on computer. Sounds weird, I asked her to call manager, and she tells me  she cannot catch hold of managers, and unfortunately gym members have to suffer because of that. Strange? Wait gets better. I insisted that this is just straight up ridiculous and once she saw me losing temper, she call manager from her cellphone and looks like now she got permission to cancel (the computer story was BS). Further, she said that I have an option of sending mail - when I had to correct her that I was told 'certified mail' only, and then she admitted doesnt have to be certified mail. Clearly the absolute worst when it comes to efficiency, and the fact that you wouldnt even try to solve an issue shows clear incompetence of the staff.	null	null	0x89c2943160854c13:0x4d8a93fd6ea5fb15	0

My right to get an EDL has been unrightfully denied !!!! ****Up date**** As of July 30th 2019 Sandra at the County Clerks Office down at the Poughkeepsie DMV called Albany and Albany said it was OK to give me the Enhanced Drivers license with my marriage certificate as is. üòäüòäüòäüòäüëçüëçüëçüëç Thank You to the Poughkeepsie County Clerks and Poughkeepsie DMV I have what I need now üòäüòäüòä And hopefully no other woman will have to go through this .	null	null	0x89dd6f215a33ad1d:0x834e898f76c9ab8f	0

They wouldn't see my daughter without a virtual appointment, which they were 15 minutes late for.  Then they tell me she can't be seen in person till she gets a COVID test, which they only offer at sites 20+ miles away from their office.  What a waste of time.    I contacted a different urgent care in Somers in the morning and they were able to see her as a walk in and take care of testing on site and see her in person within an hour.	null	null	0x89c2b35d046fa635:0xf5e7bd2164db44c2	0

There was 7 diners including us and one chef. Our first dish didn't get to us until after 35 min after being seated. The chef encourage diners to use their hands, but when you pick up the rice it fell away. It lacked the ambiance of a polished establishment and for the price expected a little more work on the aesthetics. For eg I don't need to see the glad wrap, or dirty tissues used by chef or other kitchen utensils.

They give misleading information; they basically fight with patients and call them liars! Upon walking in the office and not being greeted by any office staff, except another patient that said ‚Äúhello‚Äù to me. I had to speak to the office manager on multiple occasions prior to my visit whom assured me that this type of behavior would not happen again. However, on appointment day, it only got worse with the mistreatment by the office staff. It is hard to recommend this doctor because his office staff is absolutely horrible and they handle everything outside of the exam room, with little to no assistance. However, Dr. B is very warm and caring.	null	null	0x89c27f1c8bc31f2b:0x9f3ad8ed65567135	0

1.102582481247962e+20	Maria Mateo	1536940078646	1	I have never actually hated a place until the day I visited this place. I wanted to get my mani pedi done before going on a vacation and I wanted to look really really cute so I went in to this establishment because of the reviews. I was severely disappointed by the results. I first got my pedicure done  and it wasn't very well done but like it was livable. So I let it be but my toenails were not fully painted she didn't file down my nails or shape them as they usually do. And then I moved on to my hands, she did my nails and it was like kind of different. the way she was doing it not the way I'm used to but I digress she manage to not shape my nails properly at all, each nail was a different length and shape. And then when it came to painting the paint job was horrendous it was all over my hands like around my nails. And  I don't like to complain so I just let it go because I knew it would come out in the shower. But when my nails were drying it started to Bubble like there were jsmall air pockets all over my nail and it looked absolutely horrendous so I had to say something and I told her I was like there are some bubbles can you please fix it and she had the audacity to get mad at me like if it was my fault. she tried to fix it she was doing nothing that actually worked and then the boss guy took over and then he tried to fix it some more he didn't do a great job but he did get a little further than her. I don't like to speak ill of people's business but I feel like I should share this story due to how bad it was and the fact that it ruined part of my vacation cuz my nails had to be hidden in the pictures I was trying to take. I would like to share with you guys the name of the person who did my nails because I do know that other people at the establishment do really good jobs but I don't know her name, just be worried about who you let do your nail in this establishment.	null	null	0x89c25dbf3ebcb1f3:0xbe64b4269c2871a9	0

Yet the young woman said it would take a week. Then the older woman tried to usher us out. I guess she didnt really want to repair my rose gold. So rude.

They offered no assistance no solution no nothing.  He said if I didn't wear them he would be able to send them back to the company, which makes no sense because if you do not wear them how do you know they do not work. so frustrated.  Funny I always refuse to shop in FarRockaway and this is why. I have learned my lesson and will no longer purchase anything in FarRock. Thank you Fashions for Less for the great (not) experience.

Here's how they operate: They post dream jobs on Sittercity and Care that may or may not exist to get you to come into their closet size agency run by ex sitters. They then ask you to pay $35 for a bogus background check ( it's less than 1 paragraph long and, according to my law enforcement cousin, doesn't seem legit) and ask you to create a profile on their website telling you when you apply to jobs the parents will see your application and contact them to interview you. COMPLETE LIES. THEY DECIDE WHICH APPLICATIONS THEY SEND TO PARENTS AND THEY SEND THEIR FAVORITES AND IGNORE OTHERS. I APPLIED TO OVER 30 JOBS AND RECEIVED ZERO RESPONSE THEN FOUND OUT THIS IS HOW THEY OPERATE. KIRSTYN VAN PATTEN THEN CALLS YOU TO TELL YOU THEY CARE ABOUT YOU SO MUCH AND THEY'RE WORKING SO HARD TO PLACE YOU BUT THEY HAVE SO MANY SITTERS AND NOT ENOUGH POSITIONS.....BUT THEN YOU SEE THEM TRYING TO RECRUIT MORE SITTERS ON SITTERCITY AND CARE. THEY HAVE A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO DO THIS. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT PLACING, JUST RECRUITING. THEY'LL TELL YOU SO MANY LIES. I SIGNED WITH ANOTHER AGENCY AND WAS EMPLOYED WITHIN ONE WEEK.

Searching for jobs can be stressful and we wish we could provide every qualified and experienced individual with a frustration-free experience.\nI understand that our personalized approach to matching nannies and babysitters with families was a pain point and ongoing source of frustration for you. Our process is to carefully select the applications we forward to our families, taking into consideration any discussions we‚Äôve had with the family and providing them with the best available matches possible. There are many other websites like Care and SitterCity where there is no intermediary step between the job and the family. We exist as an alternative to those websites. While we wish we could have been the company to help you find your next childcare position, we recognize that we are not the right fit for everyone and want to congratulate you on your current position.\nI would like to reassure you that our background checks are legitimate and that our provider has been accredited by the National Association of Professional Background Screeners (www.napbs.com). It is my understanding that you did not request a full refund of the $35 background check fee, an option that is available for every caregiver who, after screening, decides not to pursue opportunities through our network. It is our policy to refund upon request, and I‚Äôve gone ahead and issued that refund today. As a reference point, background checks in New York State begin at $95. Additionally, we conduct social security traces, individual county searches in all locations where a applicant has lived for the past 7 years, and other checks that are standard for each active babysitter and nanny we work with, all at an additional cost.\nAs always, we would be happy to speak with you and encourage you to reach out if there is anything else you‚Äôd like to share. We appreciate that you've illuminated an area of communication that can be improved on our end. Thank you for your feedback.\nAll the best,\nSuzie Z.\nDirector of Operations""""}"""	0x89c25a33cf5eea0b:0x99616a8838321da4	0

They just leave you to remove all of that finishing stuff yourself and go to the next customer.	null	null	0x89c2585864a1b9e3:0x6e643a8764c30bd	0

1.0819854498896006e+20	Andrew Fagan	1557365141254	1	This complex is absolutely terrible. It‚Äôs not kept up at all very cheaply made. The staff is absolutely horrible. Suzanne is not only a liar but she is completely unprofessional with no aptitude to be in management. Barb lied to us from the beginning. We left here ready to move to Coventry green because of the size of the apartment and floor plan. Barb promised us that in 2 months they would move us to  a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom. Well we moved in and after the end of first month we inquired about the move to new 2 bed 2 ba and nothing was available when barb had told us she reserved a spot with a do not rent so it was reserved for us. Lie 1. Lie 2 she failed to mention that there was going to be over $3000 dollars to move to new place upfront. When asked about that she responded with she forgot to mention the financial details. We also had a horrible bug problem and terrible smell and put in service ticket for that. The service call was scheduled for the next day between 8-12. We‚Äôll nobody called or showed the next day. However the day after that a guy knocked on our door while we were sick, and in our room, then he proceeded to enter the apartment and came right into the master bedroom where my fianc√©e and I were in bed. I went to Suzanne about it and she apologized, I explained that my fianc√©e has certain religious beliefs and practices and that her religious practices were infringed on and our privacy was invaded. They had NO appointment that day and 0 right to walk into our bedroom. We advised Suzanne that we would not be able to stay here if this happened again. She ensured it would not. Well not even 2 weeks later we had another issue and service call and this time 4 days passed with nobody contacting us at all and then again the maintenance guy walked in unannounced into the apartment. Suzanne Met me in the office and said this should never have happened and she was sorry again and would call the manager or whatever to handle it. Nothing happened of course but my fianc√©e freedom to practice her religion and the fact that a man walked into a woman‚Äôs bedroom unannounced is absolutely against the law and any religion. I can go on and on with the issues we continued to have from Suzanne being very rude and unprofessional from that point on. We put in our 2 month notice and it was denied unless we paid over $4000.  We had the water shut off in the middle of The morning while we were in the shower.. and told that it was a random test. Needless to say we moved out on March 3rd and the apartment was rented April 1.  We took photos and videos of the apartment when we left and they will be made public record as well. Suzanne tried to say we owe over $5000 for damages and the whole lease etc.  and they will send us to collections, lol.The news as well as a lot of religious organizations are covering our story of how we were infringed upon and our freedom to practice our religion was infringed upon and we left with notice and because our rights were severely violated. They tried bullying us out of there and are trying to bully us into some ridiculous payment. We have the emails the apologies we have the move out photos which are time stamped as well as the video of each room carpet appliance and everything that was cleaned and in perfect shape. This complex and staff are the worst around and the price is very terrible. We just heard about dockside village in east Amherst. Check out their website they are brand new beautiful apartments with much bigger living space better amenities and a very friendly and very professional staff and the price is way better then autumn creek.   Stay far away from this place when 5 minutes down the road their is a much much better complex cleanliness wise as well how they look and are made. Check out any other complex before signing anything on here . I suggest you read the negative reviews as they are starting to sound very similar.  Stay tuned because this is going to be a very interesting legal battle.  It‚Äôs too bad Suzanne and her staff are liars and don‚Äôt care about the tenants.	null	{'time': 1557765797424, 'text': 'Mr Fagan, First and foremost, I want to be sure to acknowledge your feelings concerning your stay with us. All reviews whether good or bad create an opportunity for us to examine our processes and communication with residents both past and present in our dedication to excellence. I apologize that you feel you did not experience the quality that we historically deliver to every resident that walks through our doors. The awards our property has received year after year are proof of our devotion to this quest.\n\nI want to be sure to address the frustrations you mention. We understood you preferred a different apartment that was not available when you first moved in. We had 2 come available during your time with us and offered the second one to you, however you declined due to pricing stating we hid costs from you; however, the pricing was standard to anyone with your equivalent approval status as explained to you in the first application you submitted.\n\nIn reference to your apartment being entered inappropriately, we do agree there was a breakdown in communication for convenient times for you. The maintennace department entered by a service request labeling permission ok. Their usual routine is to knock, ring the door, open the door and yell maintennace before entering when we have permisioon to enter. We were unaware of your illness which altered the way we would have handled your requested service call.\n\nI, and our Maintenance Supervisor apologized to both you and your fianc√©e for the oversight. We advise and encourage our residents to use their resident portal for electronic updates to work orders which are fed to our maintenance men in real time. In addition, any and all maintenance procedures that may affect our residents such as a possible water shut off is presented in both emails and door postings including detailed times & dates. By your own admission when we spoke, you received the door posting but chose not to read it. I appreciate you taking the time to mention that i came to you and not waiting for you to come to me regarding the situation that happened again. I think that showed prompt, courteous and professionalisim towards our residents.\n\nRegardless of the opinions of fault in your review, we must always conduct our business within the structure of consistency for all residents. You reference being denied the use of a policy available to our residents. Denial is only made when all criteria for use of the policy is not met. One of the conditions consistent throughout our policies is that your account be current.\n\nWe go to great lengths to be sure our residents are well informed so there are no misunderstandings during the different stages of living at Autumn Creek. We send pre-move out letters to residents with a clear outline for moving out which includes damage pricing and what is expected for a positive move out conclusion for both the resident and management and it is also outlined in the lease. Unfortunately, our detailed electronic move out inspection with imaging for your unit showed little effort to meet those goals which resulted in charges to put the apartment back to the standard we require. Most move out charges are, in most cases, non-existent unless there are conditions that could have been avoided by the resident. In conclusion, I will again apologize that we could not meet your expectations and had to make the difficult decision to have you look elsewhere for a home that could better fit your needs. We wish you success in your home.'}	0x89d376f924328511:0x1e990efc6cd1db26	0

Once was prescribed 112 tablets for the month come home open the bag there was 12 not 112 went back got the, that's impossible we triple count them, we'll guess what if the person thought they should count out to 12 they can count it 40 times and be wrong. Didn't want to check inventory to verify they were in the wrong was more than polite even tho being run in circles, then the answer I received was someone at my house must of borrowed them (my parents lol) that was the last time I step foot in that place. Truth is Slaters borrowed them either an employee, ownership, or a honest mistake, but 100% at fault no attempt to help or fix situation had god complex we could never make a mistake well u did but I'm just 1 customer. But thru my many years of patronage were polite and helpful but as soon as a mistake happens it's ur insurance or ur doctor, or just u can't ever be themselves. Any I personally witnessed them demean people in front of other customers stating the medications aloud, just downright rude. Just remember happy customers ur day will come too and guess what it will be ur fault because u now seen this post. Best of luck to the hard working employees that do work there but pretty sure 16 year old girls answering phones do not have pharmacy licenses to be filling ur prescriptions just watch most of the time they are doing it themselves oh u got training to answer the phone now here go fill John doe's cancer meds for the month, John goes home and has a made on TV item, chapstick and a pack of cigs for his cancer treatment plan courtesy of the good folks at slaters drugs this message was not approved by trump because it is factual.	null	null	0x89e837f58ea5f3d5:0x33a3aece8182ddab	0

1.0708126773649975e+20	Shannon Meher	1601130296402	2	I‚Äôm a new customer to Browns Ford of Johnstown‚Äôs service department , but I am not new to customer service or service departments. I‚Äôve been in the automotive industry for 20+ years and I‚Äôve seen a lot and I‚Äôve learned a lot. When I called to make an appointment to have the oil changed on my daughters 2008 Ford Fusion, the gentleman was nice and courteous. He advised me that they were very busy, but if I could drop it off that coming Saturday they could squeak it in. Fair enough. I dropped the car off at 9am and dealt with Nate. I was the only customer in the service department at the time. He didn‚Äôt greet me, I greeted him and advised him that I have appointment to drop off my vehicle for an oil change. I also asked if the technician performs a complementary multi-point inspection he replied ‚Äúyes‚Äù. I was happy to know this because my daughter just purchased the vehicle and we wanted to be sure all was well. Now, I know how these inspections are supposed to be done, but I also know how incomplete/incorrect they can be. I feel that these inspections are very important. Not only for the customer, but also for the shop. Many times during these inspections the technicians will find issues that the customer may not be aware of. At that point, the customer should be made aware of any necessary repairs and/or services needed. Before I left, I asked Nate if I needed to sign anything, he said ‚ÄúNope, I‚Äôll call you when it‚Äôs done.‚Äù I did not receive a phone call all day. I decided to called the service department at 3:45pm, I was told it was done and I could come get it. Surprisingly I asked Nate if the tech found anything, he replied ‚ÄúNope.‚Äù Now I mentioned earlier, this is a 2008 Ford Fusion, c‚Äômon he couldn‚Äôt find anything, anything at all? No recommended service? Nothing? I brought the vehicle in knowing that there was issues. There was a severe exhaust leak, oil leak, the hood latch was seized and the brakes are spongy. I had to be sure that the oil was changed so I asked Nate to check the hood latch, because we could not get it open ourselves. I also asked him if the tech said anything to him regarding the oil leak, he seemed surprised and advised me he was going to speak to the tech and call me back. This is why I am giving 2 stars instead of 1. One, for the gentleman who took the appointment and one for Nate going out to the car, checking the hood latch, then calling me back and letting me know that the he lubricated the latch and advised me the oil leak was due to the oil filter not seated properly. He then took my credit card payment over the phone and he told me he would leave my keys and paperwork in my car because they were closing soon. I picked up the car just to find a copy of the receipt with no multi-point inspection attached. I told my daughter that we should go to Browns Ford do the service on her car because they have certified Ford technicians that know her vehicle in and out. They also know her maintenance schedule. I was told that it needed nothing. After leaving the dealership, I went to another garage. I had exhaust work completed, brake work completed and a tune-up done. If someone called me and told me what the car needed and what was recommended, I would‚Äôve gladly spent my money at Browns Ford. I know the service department is capable of more, and pointing fingers will not help. I feel that the service advisor and technician saw a 2008 Ford Fusion and felt, ‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt gonna buy anything‚Äù I know this because I‚Äôve been in their shoes, but in order to be successful you must do those estimates that might take a long time, because you never know, you cannot judge a book by its cover. There‚Äôs also the safety aspect, the brakes! You must CYA! There is no way that the technician didn‚Äôt notice that the brake pedal was all the way to the floor when he drove it in. This is unfortunate but true. Good luck in the future, I know that with guidance and training your service department can overcome these issues.	null	null	0x89de8d299865299b:0x540254e967f19015	0

I brought it to my husband's mechanic two days later because neither of those issues made sense (no issue with the wheel or braking) and he said there's was nothing wrong. I was aware that dealership mechanics tend to obsess trying to find a way to make a buck, but I wasn't aware that included lying. I'm only giving 2 stars because the waiting room was kid-friendly and everyone I interacted with- including the mechanic- was polite.	null	null	0x89de8d299865299b:0x540254e967f19015	0

I was told to come into the office to turn in my plates, keys and a power of attorney form in order for them to release my payment check. They are still charging for a car that THEY totaled, that THEY took possession of, as well as the plates. I was told that that never happened, that they never took the plates. There is some sort of shady stuff going on in this office. Suffolk PD I talked to seemed to think they sold the plates for money. So now I need to report them as stolen with the PD and they need to investigate the employees in this office. Please please avoid these people. I am a million percent happier with my new car and my new policy at GEICO.	null	null	0x89e849268517968d:0x6c45a3fc2f67860c	0

They mess up in every which way possible. For my aunts funeral they forgot to paint her nails which were purple and she had dried up blood on her neck. she did not look good at all, for my uncle they completely changed his skin Tone and blew him up like a balloon, for my cousin they never cleaned his body or fixed his hair. He still had sand on his hair nails and a hole in his collar bone area. and for my father they completely sucked his face in. His eyes were caved in and cheek bones as well. You can see his skeleton right thru his skin! And they put his date of death all wrong on the cards we ordered. When we asked for them to correct them they were very snobbish about it and said they couldn't do anything about it. And also for my grandfather they made him totally unrecognizable. Please dont bring your loved ones here. It will make the process of grieving much harder. üíî	null	null	0x89c2f386da7a115d:0x4498a28f83af831e	0

1.1118824322880315e+20	John McKinney	1523632529341	1	We had high hopes for this day care as it‚Äôs right around the corner from our apartment‚Äîwe thought it could be ideal for rainy days like today. The bitter woman behind the counter, who seemed to be a manager, was incredibly irritable from the moment we walked into the store. Our Havanese genuinely wasn‚Äôt a good fit for this day care, because the other dogs were too large. Our puppy plays with big dogs at dogs parks typically 6 days a week, but these dogs were very assertive with our Havanese. The reason for this one star rating is because the bitter woman only smirked while the larger dogs swatted our puppy. He is always so amiable, but in this situation he ran into an open crate for safety. He‚Äôs six pounds and there were three 35+ lbs dogs aggressively scratching and swatting him. Again, our dog wasn‚Äôt the right match for this day care. The single star rating is because of the woman who let this all happen, hands on her hips, smirking, while my partner and I were stuck outside in the rain watching from the window as sternly instructed.	null	null	0x89c25850ea8f7afd:0x2883638ae9764423	0

One would think that if that's what time you publicly posted as being open you'd be ready for business! I called 7:15 They were not ready couldn't tell me if they had any open availabilities  told me they would call me within the hour. The guy sounded a bit annoyed actually that I called early as if I was interrupting his sleep or something.

Well the woman washing my hair spoke no English  and  had no idea how to treat natural hair. She was combing my hair  from root to tip, I  had to stop her several  times.  The owner wasn't  there but her daughter  was. I was clear what  I wanted and  she  assured me they knew how to treat natural hair. It didn't  stop there, I  asked for a heat protectant and  she told me I had to buy a bottle üòí. Her attitude  and  disposition was off putting and she was a poor representative  of her mother's business.

I have been going here for three years and the last time I went to get my contact lens prescription refilled they told me that they contacted my insurance and that the lenses weren't covered, so I paid about $500 believing them (my first mistake).  So upon needing a refill I contacted them in the ballpark of 15-20 times over the course of two months and never got a response. Finally I did a few days ago and I told the supposed Manager Igor what happened and he did NOT OFFER A RESOLUTION he simply ignored it, and I know that because his IPhone shows """"read"""" when he sees a message.  So then I asked for a copy of my prescription, and he gladly offered to send me that instead of resolving the conflict and he also told me that he was unable to contact my insurance company even though I was able to reach them, again another lie. SO then I call the orchard street location and the guys decide they want to play games, wouldn't tell me who I was speaking to, pretended they were both IGOR and then one said he was the owner.  THEY DO NOT DESERVE BUSINESS.  Terrible customer service.  It explains now whey they keep turning over their opticians."""	null	null	0x89c25987279ded5d:0xf3f509c2c8cd7221	0

The woman on the phone had a bad attitude and scheduled the appointment for June 2nd. I go on the 2nd and have to wait more than an hour to see their pa because the doctors are rarely ever in the office, and when she finally felt like seeing me she wouldn't give me clearance. I then called my surgeon's office and they made an appointment with a more respectable and knowledgeable physician and was in and out within the hour with my medical clearance. At Sisselman's office all they're good for is checking your vitals. For anything else they want to send you off to different doctors they know.

1.1357589853657519e+20	Beatz Goy McCormack	1601560021284	1	So I pick my wish orders up from here and other than that I have nothing positive to say about the place. I immediately feel uncomfortable when I walk in like I'm walking into a stranger's home and pulling up a seat while the family is at the table eating dinner... The customer service seems to only confirm that my uneasiness is warranted. I heard they had pretty good deals on phone and I needed a new one that was a substantial upgrade so I gave this place a shot. I'm not well versed in the latest phone tech or what they are going for and for this lack of preparation I take full responsibility but the rest of my experience falls on the store. I asked for a phone at least 3 times and was told the cheapest was $250. Ok I thought but it must not have been on because the kid and his younger cohort both turned away 2 or 3 times before finally showing me a refurbished Samsung A20 for exactly $250. I use Samsung's and I needed a phone asap and I wanted to get out of that place post haste so I took it without price checking it... I will never do that again as long as I live. I was drastically overcharged. So while checking out the clerk encouraged me to take cash from the ATM to avoid a service charge at the register so as strange as the request was I complied and paid up. I gave him an extra 20 by mistake and he returned it immediately so for that I am greatful.. thank you. Now havjng paid and in possession of my merch I wait for him to signify that the transaction is closed which I guess was when he went about his earlier conversation and ignored me once again. I left and thinking how strange all of that was and then the sinking feeling you get on a roller coaster when you know your going over the hump and down fast whether you like it or not hit me.... He never gave me a receipt.... So that was my experience it is what it is and maybe you will have a better one but for me I will never do anything other than pick up my parcels and this place which actually saves me Money on shipping so maybe in like 35 visits I'll recipe my losses on that phone...	null	null	0x89daee5624d37755:0x9a942dc7f9b29804	0

We exchanged greetings and she asked could she help me find anything, I told her no thank you, and continued on to the snack aisle for pistachios. I noticed upon arriving in the aisle the lady who greeted me was staring from the corner peeking around watching me. When she noticed I noticed her she turned away. I didn't let it bother me. And I continued to look at pistachios (nice selections regretfully saying). Next thing you know another lady employee walks up the aisle towards me. You won't believe what she asked me. Her exact words were """" what are you stealing? I seen you put something in your pocket. """" this is in front of customers and my fiance. My mind couldnt even compute what happen! After all of this was done she walked away with out a word. The manager comes back and they checked my pockets they also took a look in my bag. After finding nothing and being proved wrong. I asked for each acussers info. He told them hush and you never said those things to him. He's a fool and an idiot. The worst part alot of people just stood by and found it humorous. The male manager was very rude and said leave my store I'm calling the police. I know you stole something. I knew i couldnt leave the scene because its a whole retail chain vs ME i had to wait for the cops to protect my safety. After this the police come, they tell me to wait while they check the cameras. Shortly after they return and tell me I'm free to go I took nothing. On the cameras they see my hands never even left my pockets. I didn't even touch not a single item in the store but I was targeted and labeled a thief then publicly embarrassed and on top of that cops were called on me. This store falsely accused me the moment I stepped in that door. To make matters worse after I asked for the information the male manager was coercing and persuading the cops and his emoloyees to agree with him and lie too. Its really sad in this world people will label you violate your dignity and your character. My skin shouldn't make anyone feel the need to watch me when i come into a store. Then to lie as an employer is beyond me. The manager Alex called to sort things out. She spoke and apologized. But i want it from him. He was man enough to send women do his dirty work. Then tell them to lie. He's needs to be fired. No remores after being wrong. Not even a but empathetic. A Person who exhibits this behavior will only misrepresent your company. Because of this i dont even want to go in the area.  I'm so embarrassed and disappointed by this event. Thank you for your call Alex. But that manager has to go. He's going to cause further chaos in the future with his methods of racial profiling and false accusations. I am seeking an attorney for this matter. This cant happen again anywhere ever. You never know what someone is going through or who that person is. So how do you feel so comfortable placing a negative & false accusation on a person. The grief its been causing me and my lady. She works right there and now everytime i pick her up. Ill have to see that cvs. The cvs who profiled and labled me. She has to walk with the guy who it happened to from her job everyday! Truly embarrassing and a hit on both of our spirits and mind. We the people deal with enough. Why make living in it harder. Do better. Now shes uncomfortable as well. Guess who's dealing with it? Me. I really hope your happy CVS"""	null	null	0x89c25993ca08e313:0x1ea70097bd1916e8	0

They did ask if I wanted to get a modular but really didn't explain all the benefits except the bank would give me a better rate. I would suggest one. Steeper roof last longer, dry wall walls are better then having the seams. Also sales man really didn't sit down with us. I would have loved cable and phone lines installed in the walls. I probably would have done more upgrades if asked. Doesn't make sense why they didn't ask. Wouldn't have their commission been higher? So now we have cable and phone lines coming threw the floor. Once they installed the double we told tgem of some issues with it and it seamed we where bothering them. We still, after 7 years have a crake in our kitchen counter and broken roof shingles.

1.1291017879492157e+20	Katerina I	1579821658824	1	If I could I would put 0 stars. I visited that place 10 months ago. I really let it go and tried to forget about it but unfortunately  I received a bill that reminded me what I went through!! Starting from the beginning when I showed my insurance card and asked them  if they take it they told me they do.. But they charged me more for my co-pay. I reassured them that they were making a mistake but the lady on the front desk she was insisting that I was wrong and she was right.  In a few words instead of paying the co -pay for $25 that I usually do I've  payed $60. I didn't argue with them because I was in  pain and my foot was hurting a lot and really wanted to  get relief as soon as possible. But instead of getting well I got worse. They gave me crutches and assured me that crutches will help and that were covered under insurance. Actually they just took x-rays and advise me to follow up with a doctor which I did. But until I go to the doctor my other foot was starting hurting too and  I couldn't walk at all. I was giving weight on my other foot while using the crutches so now both feet were in a lot of pain.Eventually crutches didn't help me  at all like the doctor said to me , I don't want to say her name, said the crutches will help me until I follow up with my doctor.  Now after 10 months they are sending me a bill to pay for the crutches $53 when you can find the same ones at Amazon for $28. Very UNPROFESSIONAL people !! Better go to the emergency room .

1.1045344536174372e+20	Linda Kruger	1600812886888	1	Two months ago my mom was diagnosed with brain cancer. We had to move her into our home. We had to create a bathroom that wasn't there before for her for when she gets to the point of needing a wheelchair as she is currently using a walker. 2 months ago we order a tub shower combo for her. We waited 4 weeks for it to come in. When it arrived, it was shattered. We were told they didn't have any more in stock of that particular tub, but could order another one that is similar but we would have to wait another 3 weeks. We agreed for the other tub to be ordered. When it came in, they tried charging extra because this one had other things attached to it. We told them no you will not charge extra as you already took our money, delivered a broken tub, and didn't have another one that we ordered available. Next thing we know, while the delivery truck was in route to our home, it broke down. They called to notify us that because of this, they wouldn't get it to our home for another week! I called the Rochester branch and informed them that thus is not my problem, it's yours and you already delivered a broken tub, my mom has cancer, is starting chemo and radiation and doesn't need to be in an environment that is full of construction due to their first failure of delivering a broken tub and this needs to be fixed now! Scott was the only one who would be willing to work with me and thankfully the tub was delivered the next morning. But it gets better! My fiance ordered some electrical supplies for the bathroom, and the next day when he went to pick them up from the Holley branch, he was told that Jake wouldn't allow the items to go because they weren't placed as an order! HE ORDERED THEM FROM HOLLEY AND HOLLEY NEEDED THEM AND JAKE REFUSED TO PLACE THEM ON THE TRANSFER TRUCK! Yet again setting us back!!! So now my mom is moving in to my home this coming Sunday because her home is sold, and she's moving into a construction zone that should have been done a month ago because this company doesn't know what they're doing! I highly recommend that you stay away from this company. They lack communication, professionalism, and customer service! They'll tell you that something is in stock, you go there and there's NOTHING THERE! If you use this company, good luck!	null	null	0x89d14abe00a063e3:0x99e4e0b95d4e82df	0

I finally got a hold of an associate to help me find a bathroom vanity and he was very enthusiastic but he never got back to me so I purchased a 600 dollar vanity and sink from Wayfair who was very helpful over the phone and also purchased a 200.00 dollar faucet to go with the sink. I'm glad the associate never called me back because I'm very happy now.

I bought over 2K worth of furniture from this store at once back in February. They did mistake on their delivery, and it was incomplete, and missed part of my purchase that I paid extra money for! I called them multiple times, first their excuse was covid, so I waited few months. Then now ‚Äúoh waiting for shipment‚Äù, after 7 months. The person who dealt with us was Mash, and he kept on also giving multiple excuses saying he will call me back. He never did.

1.139572956987636e+20	loret ford	1541243099252	2	Go to this store only if you're VERY PATIENT or DON'T NEED YOUR FURNITURE RIGHT AWAY. All these 5 star ratings were given the day of purchase because they ask you to rate them right away after a good deal is given. I bought a bed, mattress, the foundation and a dresser on Mon, Oct 1st and was told to expect delivery by Saturday. I waited patiently till Friday afternoon to call to find out delivery time since nobody reached out. I was then told the bed will take 5 WEEKS to deliver so pick a new one. Totally understandable at this point. Mon, Oct 8th, I picked a different bed and was assured by the store manager he'd personally handle the transaction. Nobody is professional enough to call you with any update! 3 WEEKS after my initial purchase and a request to cancel my order, the bed was delivered. Dealing with the delivery company was even more frustrating than the wait time. The delivery guy cut and damaged the bed and didn't say a word about it. I noticed it when i got home but at that point my cousin had already signed the paper stating everything was good. The dresser was delivered about 9 days after the bed was delivered. I didn't bother contacting them about the damage or ask when the dresser was going to be delivered honestly because I was just over the entire situation. 4 WEEKS and some days is what it took to get my complete order so like i said initially, if you don't need it right away or  don't mind the wait then go ahead with them since they do have good deals.	null	null	0x89c2f33635e9d93f:0xdecf8e3c8ea9fa9c	0

This is a Huge place with alot of selection. Surprisingly has a big selection of pipe tobacco in bulk jars sold by oz.   Unfortunately, a lot of the jars were poorly kept.  Dried out and spotted mold in one of the jars. Skipped on the bulk tobacco because of what I saw.  They had a decent selection of pipe tobacco tins and alot of the low end bagged bulk pipe tobacco brands.  They have a separate room for cigars and had a pretty nice selection, once again some of the cigars seemed a tad dry but not ruined.  They even have vape and glassware if you are into that.  This place also has seating but it's for the lotto players because they do not allow smoking inside.   An enormous place like this that has a good selection of pipe and cigar stuff that has seating but doesnt allow smoking makes no sense...The biggest detractor would be that the people running this place are not smokers.  Did not seem to have much knowledge of the products and when asking about some of the jar tobacco before I spotted the mold and was handed crispy tobacco....the person helping me was trying to convince me to buy a blend with """"try this it smells great."""" Couldn't tell me what the blend consisted of. Didn't even realize the tobacco was dried out to a crisp... had to read the label to describe the blend which I could read for myself...SMH.  Red flag for me.  Atleast in the Mr Tobacco in smithtown, the people in there know what they are selling, I'll stick to them"""	null	null	0x89e82f74e0b539d3:0xaed2c697fa7ef714	0

It's a shame that the people who live here have to live in the dirt and squalor that exists in the building. There's no dignity in living at the YMCA in White Plains or is there any decency left in its operation. Hopefully the new owners of the property will tear it down and build something even better in its place.  This is a message to all the executives at the YMCA association of America.

Because of this you end up learning the same skills over and over again instead of learning something new such as parallel parking, or making 3 point turns.

Nothing is homemade contrary to the earlier post that was probably made by an employee or the owner, sauce came out of giant cans, dough was cheap, thin, and tasteless. The garlic knots were pathetic, and were just little rings with asinine amounts of butter and just a hint, and that's being generous, of garlic powder. GJP has been shady for years, and clearly they're still up to their old tricks again. Also my favorite part of my time there was the fact that we ordered our food at 730 and at 805 we finally got our pizza after the owner forgot about us long enough for us to wait in their restaurant and hopefully order something else but we didn't. Steer clear of this place! Will never be back and will tell anyone I know who lives or travels to Fulton to avoid Josies at all costs.

They never cleaned him up or wiped him down until I picked him up and said something.   They do not have anyone in the rooms with your pets.  The owner of this location dismissed it saying this is how they play.  I also called the franchise owner and he stated the same.   I now bring Nico to Pet Smart.

She was having episodes like seizure. I had recorded it and showed him and he shrug his shoulder and blamed it on her dementia, two days later we wind up in the ER where she was diagnose correctly and her dosage was lowered.  In the last visit he asked me if I had questions (he only asked because I confronted him how I had questions and he had never asked if I did, while having one foot out my front door) and when I said yes, underneath his breath he said """"of cause you do"""".  What an insensitive humane being Dr Sol. J Grazi is!! I let hime have it of cause.  I am confused about something, why does he get to work here and live in Israel where he is always at when I have called.  Isn't there enough doctors right here In the US?

This is basically an old fashion style deli not a German deli as someone previously stated. The main problem here is sanitary, there are 3 guys that work the counter, a Spanish fellow, a Black man, and a white guy the owner, the Black man always wears gloves when touching food, the owner sometimes wears 1 glove but it often has holes and you can tell it's touched everything. Today I ordered 2 buttered rolls and the Spanish guy grabbed the 2 rolls with his bare hands then he held one of the rolls down in the center with his bare fingers as he spread the butter, I complained and the owner then made him put gloves on and make 2 more rolls of course now there was almost no butter. I hope nobody came in looking for a buttered roll as I'm sure they would have gotten my rejected ones. Time to quit coming here.	null	null	0x89c26248c808463f:0x7243e4ea86e02eac	0

One, the gel manicure option wasn‚Äôt on the website when I registered so I didn‚Äôt realize that the actual price was $50 vs $28. No one was clear with me when I checked in. The manicure itself was okay for the first half but something happened when my technician switched to my cuticles on the second hand. Not sure what it was but she started working on my left hand suddenly and aggressively and my left middle finger started bleeding. It bled for the next 15 minutes. I know this is hard work so I don‚Äôt fault her but I was worried about her mental and emotional health. The polish application technique wasn‚Äôt great- uneven color and missed spots. Then the massage at the end was definitely rushed. I watched the woman next to me receive a proper closing massage while I received a 10 second tug on each hand and then was sent away. She even missed one of my fingers during this whole thing. Again, I realize this is hard work and that she did her best but I‚Äôm quite disappointed especially at this price point.	null	null	0x89c25978dd057d65:0xf1471af6669e1035	0

Why am I being seen at 10 and why are people going in front of me that don't even have an appointment?? Not sure if it's the insurance I have or if I look young so they treat me however they want but no.  The doctor is sarcastic and annoying, tries to diagnose you with everything and tries to take extra tests so you can pay him more. That and he takes everything as a joke when it comes to how you explain you feel. Like he doesn't care. Only reason I come here is sometimes for  referrals.

Besides this obvious safety issue there is always drama at chase bank, they close the bank sometimes without notifying customers, there are days where you come in and you can tell something insane happened there like the photos I posted here, the bank looks run down with the interior design, machines be out of order all the time, always unclean and messy, long wait times to to talk to a bank representative, long lines for the bank tellers, Chase doesn't accept cash advance if you have a discover credit card, they don't take coins and make you do their work by putting them into a coin cardboard roll which is impossible to do. They have high fees but they at least tell you about it, the banking details is the same at any bank but the services are not. The Manhattan chase banks have a superior customer service if you go to the wealthy areas but if you live in poor or middle class areas of New York City like the outer boroughs then you are stuck with mediocre and horrible service. For the fees of this bank and how wealthy they are, it's unacceptable to have bad service like this. The list go on about how bad this place is.  Enter at your own peril!!!!"""

The wine was good, though overpriced.  The server was very good and attentive, so no complaints about the service.  It is too bad that the kitchen failed so miserably.

Went in today to pick 2 prescriptions, 1 was ready and the other wasn't and I kept on telling them and I really need other more because it's more important than the other and I also knew that they have been working on the other for over a week or more and still why wasn't it ready?	null	null	0x89c262f40d75984f:0x53585b7e3b4e088c	0
1.0858856966589178e+20	Rich Terrana	1570005121767	1	CVS Routinely attempts to overcharge me for prescription medicine I use that is not covered by my insurance.  One time I called the CVS pharmacy and the auto-response told me I have two scripts ready and the total was over $1100. When I called back and asked the pharmacist, she confirmed that the price was correct. I asked how is that possible if it cost me $27 at another local drug store last month for the same medicine. I was told that this is the price CVS charges for that medicine and they couldn't do anything about it. So a national chain that sells mega quantities of a drug can't match or beat the price I get from a local independent pharmacy? There's something wrong here. Last week I went in and was told my normal $66 price for one of my medicines was going to cost $130+ this month. Until I asked if they applied the Good RX coupon, then the price was lowered to $66. I mean, really CVS? That they are so greedy they will attempt to rob consumers instead of giving their best price is disturbing. Buyer beware, they will rob you if you let them!	null	null	0x89c262f40d75984f:0x53585b7e3b4e088c	0

1.0954365325723641e+20	samspinchat	1564317548393	1	This store does not care about opening on time. It is supposed to open at 8am but I was there at 8:05am today and it was locked tight with no sign of any employee. You might think that is a one time thing but it's not. I don't go to this store often but a year or two ago I went on consecutive Sundays and the store was still closed at 8am and did not open until almost 9. That's a pattern and I see it's still the same. How can a major chain like CVS tolerate unreliable employees that make the entire chain look bad? I wrote a complaint to CVS when the store did not open twice a few years ago and I got a call back from the manager who really couldn't care less, said that one employee didn't show up so they couldn't open up with less than two employees for security reasons. I can understand that but if your employees repeatedly don't show up for work on time and you cannot open the store on time, fire that employee and hire someone who will come to work on time.	null	null	0x89c262f40d75984f:0x53585b7e3b4e088c	0

I just watched a CNN special about CBD. It showed both the good and  bad side. It showed wonderful effects which gives me hope for my loved one who suffers sever arthritis pain. My worry is that he also take other meds for his heart and blood pressure as well as for the pressure in his eyes. While the FDA is still in the works with this a state has taken the step to have strict testing and has ordered that ALL cbd products must have an ingredients list showing levels and purity. I'm hoping this store does this too. At the end of the CNN program Dr.Gupta said something to the affect that cbd has done good things and should be respected but must be regulated as well. I would love an email from your establishment if you would so that I could be educated on this.Thanks so much.	null	{'time': 1569816697111, 'text': 'Are u local and able to come visit stop and much easier to show you and help educate you to the best of are knowledge and hope to get a better rating out of you!!'}	0x89d6b3836bfb890b:0x58936ad1def4f765	0

Went for months, couple of times a week, she actually got more rude despite being a recognized regular. In fact, she seemed resentful for inexplicable reasons. Eventually I noticed she is like this with other people too, with rare exceptions. Go elsewhere, there are tons of other, more professional and better food trucks to patronize and not get a nasty disposition.	null	null	0x89c25c221036bfbb:0x182347ea546b9665	0

They placed me on hold and then referred me to the fine print that says they don't guarantee the color.

I don‚Äôt think it is right for one of the hairdresser‚Äôs to bring her children and one is a baby every time.  The young male child was all over the salon. He was even sitting next to me at the dryer flipping a bottle.  A salon is not a daycare.  Women want time to have adult conversations and chill from work.  This same hairdresser was about to make a big mistake with my hair again.  I think she has been distracted by her kids. She wants to bring her son then give him a place to sit in the back with something to do.  But, why she would want her baby breathing in those chemicals on a daily basis?  It was disappointing and unprofessional of this hairdresser.	null	null	0x89c25e657e4f003b:0x2ed871f0e96cc564	0

1.0271262105724822e+20	Joel Pena	1591472864563	1	The worst tire shop you can go to. I bought four brand new tires at pep boys, which is across the street from this location. Due to the LONG wait time of three hours, I decided to give these guys an opportunity. I took everything to them, and the only thing they had to do was to replace the tires and balance them out. I understand with this current, and this pandemic we are in everyone is going through a tuff time. These people, including the owner Carlos, have no respect, ethic, or manners to customers. Every customer should be treated with respect, and if you, as a business owner, don't agree, I do believe that you can find a solution. These people will do everything in there power to rip you off and take advantage of you. I had initially requested to take my rear tires home with me since they were still right replacement tires if anything had happened to the new ones. They had an issue with that, why that‚Äôs a great question. To make the story short, they decided to give me different tires that my vehicle did not have from the beginning SCAM. That had me fueled up, which then led to an altercation. I‚Äôm the type of person I give respect to be treated with respect. The best thing I did was walk away from the situation. I do not recommend them. Take your business elsewhere, and I can guarantee you this is not the first time they have encountered stealing tires from customers to sell them then forward. If that‚Äôs the case, then be honest from the beginning.	null	null	0x89c27d1e3bce4725:0x6e61eac98f965598	0

I have tried, but can no longer put up with owner's (Sal) rudeness & need to cause drama with customers & staff . He embarrassed & treated staff like idiots, I felt bad for them. He seemed to like to belittle people, and play games with your meds. He'd told me he'd order your specific brand because one have me a headache,  then,make me wait days, just to then give me the ones he knew made me ill that he had the whole time anyway. Higher prices than CVS to boot. I Recommend not going to this pharmacy.  He would also yell at you if you went Somewhere else. I got my records from him & don't plan on going back. The ONLY thing he always has that other pharmacies don't is a need to treat you like you're not important & deserve any Common-courtesy.	null	null	0x89c2dcade79bc9ef:0x1fcffb5ea5374d41	0

After taking $1500 from me, her stuff were so rude and they do not get back to me to tell me whats happening. When finally after two years they told me I have a court hearing, she gave me the choice of paying extra $650 more to represent or sign a paper that she is no longer my lawyer. I chose to sign the paper because it is uncontested and nothing to represent me for. It took them till a day to my court hearing to present me with the paper to sign after numerous calls. Also they refused to give me my file stating that I go to the court and ask for a copy. My experience with her and he stuff was very very horrible.

The mechanic told her that the tire size was wrong even though the tire was obviously after market in not the original size so he sold the new tire because she didn't know better. After putting back the wheel with the new tire they over tighten the lug bolts and one of the lug  bolts had to be replaced.

Mesquito infestation in October when it should of been to cold for them to live outside, they were coming out of the vents and through the hole in the utility closet that runs to the basement. Owners and staff unresponsive, said they sprayed but issue didn't resolve, women in the office even said she thinks the basements are wet. Spoke to another tenant who complained of mold in the closet and her daughter having respiratory issues. Another said her ceiling collapsed due to a leaking pipe and it still wasn't fixed two weeks later, not to mention her personal belongings being ruined. Oh I also had a bee infestation at one point, they were nesting in the exterior wall by the window and getting in somehow, the maintenance guy thought it would be a good idea to just spray foam the gap where they were which then forced the trapped bees into the apartment.

Food was quite good: ceviche is more akin to thinly sliced sashimi, gnocchi are rich and smoky, lamb is nicely executed, and halibut is perfectly light and tasty. The service, however, is abominable. Our waiter acted as if his previous experience was at some obscure one-star restaurant; he was pushy and unpolished and lacked the ability to read his diners. A simple martini had to be ordered three times before it was relayed to the bar correctly; a special gin drink of the evening apparently prohibited us from ordering anything else with gin in it. The space is modern and handsome though far too loud. Screaming at the top of our lungs to be heard is obnoxious at dinner; my ears were still ringing in the morning.	null	null	0x89c25986a89e3dbf:0x15914e7feb73b3ec	0

Get there and Jason states that they don‚Äôt take cash deposits because people steal uhaul trucks. I guess he was trying to make the situation better. Lol!!! So he calls his general manager Russell singer which I asked to speak to and he refused to come to the phone. Big red flag. But said that I can use a friend or family credit card over the phone.

The woman who did my pedicure dug so far into the sides of my nails for so long they were extremely inflamed and swollen. I watched as she also wiped away traces of blood. She spent so long tearing away the skin around my nails that she finally noticed I wasn't comfortable; her response was then to squeeze my toes and ask if they hurt. ...What do you think ma'am. My cuticles were fine before I walked in and now I'm leaving with red swollen toes and pain for 2 weeks. I had an infection following this visit, and I was away on vacation so I couldn't seek medical treatment right away. I enjoy a nail tech who takes their time to really give my nails the treatment they deserve, but even the cheap cost does not make up for poor work. The lady who worked on me took 40-50 minutes just to file and clip my cuticles. That is too long to complete a simple task. That's more than 2 minutes per toe for filing and clipping. I gave the 2 stars for the cheaper prices and professionalism another employee offered as I left.  The polish choices could also use an upgrade, but were not terrible.	null	{'time': 1528209693642, 'text': 'Hi J F, we apologize for this inconvenience.

The owner seemed nice and started my toes, but had to leave midway. Another lady took over but was a bit rough on the toes. It seems after the owner left it was party time for the staff. Loud music and talking. One tech actually threw her legs up on the table and started doing her own toes.  My nails came out ok, but wasn't the neatest job, the acrylic was kind of fat and bulky, could have been filed down way more. This is a Spanish owned and operated business. I get it, the loud chatting and music...to each it's own.	null	"""{'time': 1542662361219, 'text': """"Hi Mel, I'm sorry you didn't have a good experience here.

One of the drivers had a cast on their leg the other assistant had alien contacts eyes and was extremely inexperienced. They actually had me come out of the car and help them remove the tire because it was frozen they needed me to kick the tire and in this hole outrageous ordeal they lost by a lock set for removing the tires it's been over a month-and-a-half and they do not order me a new lock set complaining that it was too expensive that I should go online and get a cheaper apparently they want the customer to do the work for them. I've been driving around with no lockset in fear of getting a flat tire with no way to remove the tires for my car. Extremely poor customer service and for the last five attempts to contact them they never returned my call or attempt to replace the lockset. Will see today when I bring them to small claims court and now it's going to cost them more money because Maserati dealership is removing the lockset from the car.	null	null	0x89c2f4bc05e4c1e7:0x5eeab2eb094d4199	0

1.005525008298959e+20	Michelle Neidkowski	1621869207690	2	"""In retrospect, I wish I had given more thought to taking my dog here. My dog was making frequent diarrhea overnight and her regular vet could not get us in on a Sunday. Knowing that it was an issue that was ongoing, I did not want to wait a day to get to her regular vet so I decided to bring her here. They get 2 stars because they were able to have me bring her right away and because the tech who took her into the building as well as the tech who returned her were both polite to deal with, plus, they relieved her symptoms. I understand they cannot let clients into the building but sitting in your car in 80¬∞ sun is not pleasant, however my priority was my pet and they did warn me in advance. When I pulled up and called, the person on the phone could have been nastier but also could've been a lot nicer. She asked me a series of questions and seemed impatient to run through the roster of questions and unfortunately, I guess some of my answers were not """"yes or no"""" to fit into her little box. They came out to get my dog fairly quickly and I was able to give additional information to the tech. Dr. Kosofsky called me shortly there after, and keeping in mind I had very little sleep the night before and was getting confused as my dog had multiple recent visits to her regular vet, the vet seemed impatient and I agree with another reviewer, almost condescending. When you have a pet parent in an emergency situation, a bit of compassion would go a long way and even if you're busy, rushing through asking a client questions about their pet is not helpful or caring. Also, I wish the vet had explained what a Giardia test is because if she had told me what it was, I would've told her not to do it so I could've save myself some money but so be it, I probably should have asked knowing that our regular vet already performed that test when we adopted the dog. There were a few higher priority cases that arrived after me so in total, I was waiting about an hour and a half to two hours for my pet to be returned to me, which I understood could be the case. For the cost, I wish they had done some of the testing that my original vet recommended we have done. So I guess I think of this like the ER, you're going to pay a lot and get the most basic remedy. They will treat the symptoms but not resolve the problem necessarily. My pet's diarrhea stopped, which was the goal so for that, at least I had peace of mind. So my only other complaint is that yes, it is Covid, and I understand you don't want people in the building however, going back to the fact that it was 80¬∞ out, and I was drinking water in my car, I had to use the restroom after sitting there for an hour. I called and asked them to use the bathroom and they informed me that I could not come into the building and there are two gas stations down the road that I could try, so that's what I did. Overall I am relieved that my pets issue was attended to quickly and a basic issue resolved until I could get her to the regular vet today, but because of the attitude of the person on the phone as well as the vet, and the cost, I would not return here. If I ever need an emergency hospital again, I would consider driving further out of my way. They offered to keep my dog overnight and said I could pick her up in the morning to take her to the regular vet but I declined. I have no idea how much that would have cost but it was not worth it in my mind."""	null	null	0x89dd3f9e6ebf516f:0x83cfe82aa78f462f	0

Be careful before you accidentally spent $600+/year because you forget to skip the month. Cancelling is cumbersome and even though their customer service strongly encourages you to set an alarm to skip the month, its an annoying process and it would be highly unsustainable if every membership you had made it this difficult to cancel or keep telling you to Skip when that's not what you want to do. The clothes are very below average quality even if they do look good.

We told you that we would pay for 100% of the initial repair per the NYS warranty. The warranty clearly states that you need to bring it back to us to fix. You Refused to do so, at that point I told you exactly how much the repair would cost us to fix and we provided and sent you every dollar for that repair.\nSee most dealers don't go the extra mile of sending you money for some else to repair your vehicle for warranty repair's...  9 times out of 10 a small independent dealers will only honor the warranty if you bring it back to the issuing dealer, because that is what is required. So we tried to go above and beyond the letter of the law and We sent you our cost of the repair because you chose to have the repair done somewhere else. That was the last we heard from you, or any other of these $2200 in repairs you say you did. Something tells me if you truly had additional problems you would've at the very least asked us to pay our share of those repairs since we already sent you money for a previous repair. Either way, thanks for your business and we are truly sorry It didn't go as you wished it would. Our intention is to have all our customers happy with the service we provide.\n\nSincerely,\nAccess Auto Sales""""}"""	0x89de08cd3afae4bd:0x16bcee81e27e633b	0

I call and my insurance and confirm that it is active, then I'm told it was me who put in the wrong bday for my child...ok that could happen. Still didn't work...now I'm ready to just leave for them to say they will see her they just didnt want me to have a bill...TF who cares about a bill when it comes to their kid. See her, treat her, and I'll deal with whatever bill later with my insurance. The nurse was the only person understanding.

First one is dated on November 21, 2015 and the second prescription is dated on January 1st, 2017. As of today (10/21/2017), I am still using my reading glasses. Since my reading vision did not improved yet. I paid $3750 to Belmont Eye Center. Dr. Sandra Belmont stated at that time, I don't have to use reading glasses for next 20 years. In fact, I started using reading glasses after 3 months. Please Beware of Belmont Lasik Procedures and don't forget to record conversations with Dr. Sandra Belmont.	null	null	0x89c258ef735d6a93:0x325ed798b3155858	0

I don't recall specifically the cause of the detectors going up.  I do recall however, a student was stabbed in the lunch room, and that was after the metal detectors went up.  I also remembered a big group of students protesting the ban on cell phones.  There was a mini riot going on for that, police were called in with riot gear and shot some kids with rubber bullets.  Another event that i can recall is the one where a student was hit in the head with a baseball bat in the locker room.  Other than that, it was pretty uneventful.  Tried transferring out several times, but i guess i didn't make my case clear enough.

When it comes to what you are being seen for, the whole emergency department should bot be hearing your business. They ask you personal and private questions between curtains. I have reported this to HIPPA twice already yet the practice continues. The nurses need some training in empathy and sympathy. They are very rude,  demanding and not understanding . Left me in a room for 40 mins, with the machine beeping for 20 minutes out of the 40 mins. No one came to check on me. Even with the machine beeping profusely.

I bought an Infiniti G37 from them over a year ago, had a bad experience across literally every aspect of the deal - they talked to me like crap at first, made all kinds of misrepresentations and never made good on fixing all kinds of things on the car aesthetically before delivery. They talked me into taking the car and coming back to get the things that they committed to, only for them to hold the car for over a week and do nothing. Then when I showed up to pick it up they had some idiot in the back throw touch up paint on the fender in the dark. It was truly insulting and pathetic. Even so, I took the car and enjoyed it for a year as it was a great vehicle in good condition - i'll at least give them credit for finding decent cars to sell. Now, I recently traded that car into the Land Rover of Manhattan only to find out from them this week that some bank I never heard of claims there is an unpaid lien on the vehicle. I let these people at Queens Auto Sales handle the financing and I went home thinking that I financed through M&T Bank and paid them all year, only to find out now, that these shadeballs did some dirty dealings. Land Rover is working with me to figure it out all the way, and these clowns are about to get a rude awakening from the State, BBB, and possibly action from other parties. SERIOUSLY, DO NOT BUY A CAR HERE. THERE IS NO REASON TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE LIKE THIS.	null	null	0x89c25e4df10e07fd:0x7e1b905e436c37b9	0

1.0065061542514506e+20	christine clift	1607238042432	1	impossible to reach anyone at the local office here in binghamton. YES we are all aware of the covid situation, but how difficult would it be to help people obtain needed housing during a global health emergency. I would think that HUD would be considered more essential than Burger king or the local pub. FURTHER, i was told that the new CANAL plaza not only has income limits but the limits require that you MAKE a certain amount of money in order to be able to live there. IS THIS not a violation of human rights? I am on disability and my income is less than their requirement of thirteen thousand per year. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? So the bottom line is this, if you are poor you can not live in Canal Plaza. This is a terrible way to treat people. I am college educated but can no longer work due to my disease. SO THEREFORE binghamton has nothing to offer me that would be considered decent housing. I have lived in Binghamton for seven years and have been in a housing crisis for the entire time. BED BUGS forced me out of my first apartment, i lived there for four years. I lost everything. A sewage spill forced me out of my second apartment, it was short term but i was forced to stay (prior to the sewage issue ) because a local landlord posted a listing for an apartment that had false information. When I discovered this, I had already put a deposit on the apartment. WHen i requested the deposit back four days later, I was refused my money. He rented the unit to someone else in the same month that I PAID for. Then the sewage spill rendered me homeless and stuck in a seedy hotel then to the YWCA where I would wake up to people doing drugs in my room with room mate. Intimidation prevented me from resolving the situation there. From there to where I reside now...I had no hot, but just warm water for my first three months here. DURING A PANDEMIC>  even though i pay for my own utilities the landlord would not turn it up or allow me to do so. Second hand smoke plagues the building and triggers migraines from the vascular brain disease i have and also asthma. I am stuck here and i just want to thank binghamton for making my stay in their fine city, nothing short of a nightmare. Open up assistance for housing at HUD. its a federal program that is basically doing nothing to help those who desperately need housing. NOT EVEN A WAITING LIST is available...they say its because there are so many people in need. SO OK>>>lets just shut it down then?

It is designed and financed for cardio enthuisiasts but implements very frustrating rules for weightlifters. I dont blame them though since they dont want to spend money on employees. Money is not well managed; its often spent on machines no ones uses. Environment is not chalenging, music is bad, air conditionning is cold in winter and hot in summer (thats if its working). Half the water fountains work, and if they do water pressure is bad which is not sanitary. Staff are young, inexperienced and out of shape. Managers roam around and inexperienced in gym fitness. Almost all attending stop after a month or two. I was for a year because of convenience. Good luck trying this complex.	null	null	0x89e83f250d85dae7:0xbd8f7732482fbf96	0

One clear thing I noticed, they definitely treat new clients with a much colder attitude. I went in to ask about their pricing for balayage blond hair(180). I booked my appointment with Jaime. The day off my appointment I showed him the picture of what I wanted done. He seemed confident which in turn put me at ease. He started working on my hair and I've he took the foils off, I realised that my hair was left looking like it had new growth rather than a blended brunette into blonde transition. I should have been wary from that. I needed a trim and what looked like fabric shears were used and the cut was too blunt and shorter than the photo I had shown him. The hair was dried and styled and that's when I had the (350) surprise at the receptionist. Once I had to care for my hair, it remained brittle and would break off. They definitely didn't use any form of protection while using the bleach. All I know is never again!	null	null	0x89c25fa73b43ae91:0xe5e7f99b4fd6ad14	0

This all transpired after my money had been accepted and the reservation had been placed. If you can use any other possible option I would recommend it over using this institution.

1.0745614123492649e+20	Vatrina Faudree	1558749334622	1	In early January I was needing to move out of my apartment & needed to rent a truck for all of the furniture & the biggest boxes of stuff & was very (VERY) limited on the funds I had available. So I did some checking around into what place would be the best price for what I was needing to do, & on what day of the week I needed it for- on a Sunday. A friend recommended this place that would be the best & cheapest for moving. I called & inquired about their rates & how much it I went there on a Sunday morning along with my boyfriend & his dad to go rent a truck to move my stuff. I want to make clear that I was told about what the fees would be for not bringing the truck back with enough gas, over milage, etc. Being that it was a Sunday the store closed earlier than the rest of the week, so the time that I returned the truck was after closing. We stopped at the gas station closest to there & put gas in the truck, went over actually. then we proceeded straight to the store to drop off the truck how I had been instructed to do. The next morning I was checking my email & noticed an email from them as my receipt for returning the truck, however what the email said was the total charged for renting the truck was different than what I had & was given before I even left with the truck. Instead what I saw was what I'd budgeted beforehand & paid for, but an extra $70.00+!!! The email receipt said that I'd returned the truck without refueling it, AND an extra 5 more miles!! WTH?! It over drafted my bank account & caused me overdraft fees too!!	null	null	0x89de732e6b2ef549:0xfcb3374b656451e3	0

Returned to location, explained this to manager who said it was rented 6 times in the last week with no other complains.  Regardless of previous rentals there was an issue when I rented it and during the inspection of the truck when I returned it, I WATCHED the person who goes through to make sure everything is okay, rip the green pin for the dolly off as if I had used it (which I didn't).  I wonder how many other people have been ripped off the same way they attempted to do to me?!

All they want to do is give useless injections that don‚Äôt last because they make a lot of money on them. This is how they treat patients, she made up stories that will stay with me on my medical record for a lifetime, I came in on a last minute appointment the patient liaison got me in order to give a urine sample before they took over my treatment and was treated completely inappropriate. I was glad to give a urine sample. Looking forward to s smooth transition to their practice as was promised by Dr Catania. Then this appointment with Julie ruined my life. I don‚Äôt even know what happened all I know is that I had nothing to hide and was accused of things. On my permanent record now and nothing I can say or do to eliminate the lies. They will drop you as a patient because you are honest with them, your pain, struggles, no offer to help you fix them, try to understand them or talk with my primary doctor. My prescription matched what my dr had prescribed and they told my doctor lies about my appointment in their office.. accusing me of things I didn‚Äôt say. . I was also preparing to have a nerve ablation and they charged $15 grand for shots leading up to that, just to be dropped from the practice right before the procedure, after seeing Julie. I needed their help with my current situation and they don‚Äôt care. Don‚Äôt trust your health to them. Go somewhere  who treats patients with dignity and respect.	null	null	0x89d98cdd07b66ae1:0x232b32db2bcaa5bd	0

Food is pretty good for what it is: an American Jewish adaptation of Israeli style middle eastern food. Operations however leave much to be desired and it seems like they just barely survive the daily lunch rush due to lack of streamlining and questionable business model. If you're kosher and taste is your priority, I'd recommend grabbing lunch here. Otherwise, do yourself a favor find the closest Halal guy.	null	null	0x89c258fe4b98a199:0x8fabb43fd66eeaa1	0
1.1419777626505067e+20	David Benjamin	1544638778140	2	Ordered a shawarma pita and thought it tasted pretty bad.  The shawarma tasted boiled like chicken from a chicken soup rather than shaved from a rotisserie.  The service was good.  They kept the door open, even in the middle of winter, and inside it was freezing.  The space is small and the layout poor, so people are often in each others way when getting to the salad bar or drink cooler.  The price was around $14 for just the pita, which is too high for such a mediocre lunch.  I won't be going back.	null	null	0x89c258fe4b98a199:0x8fabb43fd66eeaa1	0

Me not knowing for sure depending on their expertise ability to cross reference.  I got the electrical part In a couple of other odds and ends.  Tried electrical device in the parking lot after an hour of trying and speaking with the manufacturer of the vehicle was told device is not the same from 2011-2013.  Tried to return it.  Was told no returns electrical devices and the oddly enough when on the phone understood that The parts should be interchangeable and if they're not I'm out of luck after purchase. I would understand so but if we understood that the vehicles are not the same that I got the part from and the one I have To me it would be fair to return What I paid for it return it. Sadly I walked away with a part I couldn't use didn't get my money back. Moral of the story If for one next time if it's not exactly what you need don't assume.. and or verify What you're getting is what you need.	null	null	0x89d30e240d90d4b7:0x7c153c3a0f5a02bb	0

It took two hours for a doctor to see my child and there was only one family before me when I entered the office. Also be ready to be seen by doctors with no empathy for kids. After waiting for two hours I gave my son something to drink inside the waiting room and when the doctor entered the room and gave me an attitude because my son was drinking juice inside the empty room telling me that my son should have the mask on while waiting in the room. Also the doctor harsh tone of voice with my child while giving him directions even do I told the doctor to be patient because English was not his first language.The name of the doctor was Miloni Savalia.

Took him here, they said he was fine, that his lungs sound clear and he didn't have signs of infection. Didn't prescribe anything. Later that night he woke up complaining about his ear. Following day I take him to his pediatrician as I was not satisfied with what the dr there said,not even a day later, he had an ear infection and his lungs didn't sound good. The visit here was obviously a waste of time as the doctor saw nothing wrong. Last winter similar experience. They told me he was fine, and when I took him to his pedestrian he had  Walking pneumonia. Horrible! Take them to their pediatrician when possible or a hospital.

I was greeted with an unwelcoming reminder to leave my shoes and umbrella outside in the hallway before I even checked in. There was no changing room or spa area to relax in - just take your clothes off in the therapy room immediately before the massage, then get dressed, pay and leave. There are other spas in the neighborhood if you're looking for a sauna, comfy seats and a place to relax without feeling rushed.	null	{'time': 1579146477098, 'text': 'Hi Gary, I‚Äôm glad to hear that your massage therapy session was a good one. As for your disappointment with the atmosphere, your expectations were probably off because we are actually not a spa at all -- dressing rooms, sauna, etc is not what you should expect to find at a wellness and massage therapy center as Red Moon is. Most clients do comment on our beautiful space, but I can see how if you thought we were a spa then you may have been expecting something different. We do have an ample reception area with comfortable seating, complimentary speciality herbal teas, organic chocolates and other snacks, and even a fairly extensive wellness library with books to browse on everything from massage and bodywork to herbal medicine and nutrition -- so most of our clients do make themselves comfortable and enjoy our space before or after their appointment (they certainly don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúget dressed, pay and leave‚Äù). I do know sometimes there can be confusion about what to expect at a wellness center versus a spa since both types of establishments generally offer massage, to clarify: spas typically tend toward ‚Äúrelaxation‚Äù massage, beauty services, and include saunas or soaking tubs; in contrast, as a wellness center we offer therapeutic massage that, beyond being incredibly relaxing, can also effectively address a variety of health and wellness concerns - and all of our treatments and services are solely health and wellness-based (clinical herbalism and nutrition, childbirth consultations, and complementary bodywork therapies such as castor oil packs for scar tissue, cupping therapy, etc). Finally, I am sorry that the reminder to leave your shoes in the hallway upon your arrival felt unwelcoming - we certainly always strive to greet our clients warmly and make them feel at home. If a client such as yourself doesn‚Äôt notice the sign asking shoes to be removed we do kindly ask them to remove shoes upon entering in order to keep our space clean, healthy, and more comfortable for everyone. In addition, if we see someone carrying an umbrella like you were or any other extra items, then we only suggest an area to leave those things for your convenience and comfort - so that you don‚Äôt have to carry your things around the studio. As a business owner, I truly appreciate your feedback so that I can make sure that the way we suggest these things always comes across welcoming, as our intention is never to create an unwelcoming environment. You are right that there are a few lovely spas in the area if you are looking for relaxation/beautification services, but if you are ever looking for therapeutic massage in the future we welcome you to return.'}	0x89c25baa98cb92cb:0xc9449939c1d20d16	0

It's really important to us that we do everything we can to make this right. I'm sorry to hear that itching and allergies are still issues that you're working through - I know from personal experience how frustrating it can be. Our doctors make informed medical decisions and, when warranted, prescribe medication based off their decades of experience and having seen thousands of similar conditions; as you know, however, no pet is alike, and what works for one might not work for another. While I'm glad that your friends were able to provide you with some helpful advice, it's important that we stay in touch so that we know can better support you, and always be sure to take what you read online with a grain of salt! We're also happy to consult with you at any time and for any reason, including going over some of our lower priced options. I agree that veterinary care has certainly gotten expensive over the past several years, and while we do what we can to keep costs down, our primary goal is to convey the value of the high-quality care that we aim to provide. I can see from your concerns that we haven't been achieving this objective, and that's something we want to discuss with you further so that we can identify areas where we didn't meet your (and our) expectations so that we can improve.\nI'm happy to hear that you find our extended hours and extensive phone coverage beneficial - we're here to help!

It's great that they rebuilt and renovated the station a few years ago, but they need to maintain it, power wash the platform, clean up the garbage etc. When it runs, the trains are generally decent service, albeit not always on schedule. The trains here need to cleaned too, not just pick up the garbage from every 3rd train but wash them down and send the homeless to the shelter. They need to fix the """"‚¨ÖÔ∏èNext Train‚û°Ô∏è"""" sign as it no longer works. The staff are generally not seen and the information given about when the next train is coming is almost non existent. There also needs to be a station clock so that the trains follow the schedule, not just leave whenever it is approximately the time that the driver finishes his coffee."""	null	null	0x89c2660275b8fff1:0x82674fcb2adb074f	0

It's an elevated station, right around the corner from Redfern Houses, and just up the street from the police station on Mott Avenue . The station needs A LOT of work done to it but, on the bright side, the A train does run pretty well . Maybe, that's because the A runs as an express in Manhattan & Brooklyn in the daytime so it skips over a lot of stops .	null	null	0x89c2660275b8fff1:0x82674fcb2adb074f	0

My problem is in addition to the fact that I've been waiting 5 months, is that the salesman I spoke to today in Macy's furniture outlet in Westbury told me don't worry you won't be charged until it's delivered, there's no way they can tell what's going on in the warehouse as if the warehouse was on another planet but if I saw something else I would like make sure I spoke to that salesman. I was also told that people ordering the couch today would not receive it until October. This had to be the worst customer service I've gotten in person in a very long time.

She didn't have protective gear while working in her mouth and mine. I am not sure if she is even allowed to do any procedures. The dentist didn't go due to a death in his family. Instead of them cancelling the appointments she goes and works in your mouth. Supposed to have done a root canal but still experience discomfort. My family and I will not be going back due to that office manager professionalism and her lack of experience because if she had the right experience she would follow safety by wearing protective gear while working in patients mouths. She is really nasty how she talks to the patients and staff. If I was you I would look for another place! Run! Saw many patients come in with billing issues as well. As well as personal information like billing information being told out loud so everyone can hear. Instead of it being said  privately.	null	null	0x89c2f600e08df657:0x8f9e672e6aca0cd8	0

Leading to hospitalization! Save your self the drama. This place is also unorganized, keep switching the therapists as most are only interns and residents so you wont find some one stable and long term to really help your mental health and trauma goals.

I purchased a car from them come to find out the ac wasn't working but the mechanic shop across the street tried to down play it like it wasn't leaking, and the car inspection wasn't done. However, after a couple of days(with my plates being transferred to the car), they fixed the ac problem and inspected the car. Low and behold they was driving the car to put miles on it so they could inspect the car. During the time they had the car the car got a ticket (red light), and they refused to pay the ticket. So NEVER EVER allow them to put your plates on the car until your ready to leave with the car in great working condition.

I ended up returning the iphone I bought, on top of the return I got hit with a $55 re-stocking fee. I decided to get the same phone directly from the apple store in Manhattan. Apple don't charge a re-stocking fee should you have any issues or un-satisfaction with the phone (That's an A+ for Apple) and you can get an iPhone from Apple that is unlocked so your not stuck with a carrier you may not be happy with. I'm so glad I returned the phone back to this store because I'm not impressed  with there service signal. I only get 1 signal bar on the phone when I'm at home, when I usually get 5 full signal bars with T-Mobile. Will go back to t-Mobile after my 30 day prepaid finishes up with ATT. I hear Verizon is pretty good service. Might try Verizon in future. That's one of the benefits of having an unlocked phone :) Not happy with ATT having such a low signal in some areas of the Bronx, and the level of service I received at this store, including the re-stocking fee. Will never go back, or recommend this store or ATT company."""	null	{'time': 1595429814472, 'text': 'Hello B G This is not the experience we wanted you to have.

Asked caseworker to be transfered and her response was to lose my bed everynight until the place is crowded and they put me on the overflow list which took me 3 months to finally do since nobody wants to stay there there is always open beds. Management needs to be fired for locking the restrooms alone im pretty sure thats a human rights violation of some kind and for what? To save some money on maintainence hours? This results in enormous client burden, many times people will just urinate in the showers since there is no urinals and only 2 stalls on the 2nd floor both of which have faulty flushing switches. This place needs weekly visits by the coalition for the homeless so they can get their act together. I have been to many shelters but no where as terrible as this.	null	null	0x89c25c4053f90391:0xeea89a58cc50194e	0

Sure, we might have come in during Restaurant Week and okay, their Uovo Ravioli, consisting of a ricotta and spinach filling around a barely-cooked egg yolk, is a lesson in decadence, especially when paired with a truffle butter. But it doesn't excuse the tough, barely seasoned beef cheeks I got for my main course, which was still nearly inedible despite multiple dousings of black pepper and salt. Nor does it excuse the lackluster attempts at dessert, especially when it's evident that all the gelato and sorbet have been scooped from industrial-sized pre-made containers. There's plenty of other Italian restaurants to be found within a three-block radius of SD26, all of which serve much better dishes.	null	null	0x89c259a6f44a3ea9:0xe3bc7ead08c3671	0

Once we arrived that same women met us at the counter and was nice enough before handing us off to a gentleman who also works there. He was short/blunt with us right from the start which I honestly prefer and had no problem with. He became progressively more rude and condescending through more questions. At one point we needed another apple device to access the find my phone app. We shared that this was the only apple device we owned (I own an android) and he seemed struck with disbelief that I would commit such an atrocity. We then asked if we could used one of the many apple products in the store and he laughed at us with a prolonged nooooooooo. Maybe that wasn't possible for a good reason but his attitude was unlike that of any retail employee I have ever met before.

Instead they chose First transit to manage the transit system. They fail to realize that it's a large, British company who could care less about passengers or the public. So when you want to complain about Cortlands public transit system, look no further than your local elected officials and thank them for helping out a non American company who cares more about swindling the money from the federal government to give back to the British.

The first 5 weeks have not yet passed and because of the bus I've miss 6 days. For me that's 12 classes. They regularly arrive late to their stops (30 minutes late today) and sometimes do not even send out the busses they are supposed to. At one point last year, the driver for the route to the college made everyone get off of the bus at certain stops so he could count everyone and ensure they paid resulting in even more lateness. Public transportation is suppose to be reliable and effective, Cortland Transit is far from either of these, and it should be shutdown and replaced.	null	null	0x89da6c72f634bf4d:0x2fb4281495d6b034	0
